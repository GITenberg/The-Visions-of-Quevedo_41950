5</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Translator of the Visions of
Quevedo, can truly say, that the pleasure he himself derived from
their perusal in the original, alone gave him the idea of
translating them into English.&nbsp; It is believed by the writer
of this article, that the present is the only English translation
of the Visions of Quevedo, although they have been translated
into many other languages, and into French no fewer than five
several times by as many different authors: the last of which,
that has fallen under his notice, was published at Paris in 1812,
the plan of which has been followed in the present version.&nbsp;
The advertisement to that edition, contains the following just
remarks&mdash;&ldquo;The <i>Visions</i>, are regarded as the most
piquant production, that ever came from the fruitful and
ingenious pen of Quevedo, one of the best Spanish writers.&nbsp;
In general, the criticisms they present, although mixed with some
tedious detail, have much point, and do not fail in their
application at the present day.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is hoped the
reader will condescend to excuse any inaccuracies that have
escaped the translator&rsquo;s attention, and realize from the
perusal entertainment sufficient to recompense him for his
time.</p>

<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>NOTICE
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span> LIFE OF QUEVEDO.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Fracois de Quevedo de Villegas</span>, a
Spanish gentleman, and knight of the order of Saint James, was
born in 1570, at Villa Nueva de l&rsquo;Infantado; and not at
Madrid, as has been asserted by Moreri, and repeated after him in
the <i>Historical Dictionary</i> of Lyons.&nbsp; He was lord of
Juan Abbate, in the province of La Mancha, an estate of which he
bore the title.&nbsp; After having visited Italy, France, and all
Spain, and rendered the most signal services to the Spanish
ministry, he took up his residence at Madrid.</p>
<p>During his stay at court, he devoted himself to study and
composition: being considered the most polished writer of his
time, and one who united in himself the greatest versatility of
talent.&nbsp; The taste of Quevedo naturally inclined him to
fictitious composition.&nbsp; Endowed <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>with keen perceptions, a vivid
imagination, and rapidity of invention, he is not indebted to the
drudgery of research, and other men&rsquo;s thoughts for his
immortal productions: depending solely upon his own resources, he
was emphatically an original writer.</p>
<p>The author of the <i>Spanish Library</i>, expresses himself of
Quevedo, in the following terms: &ldquo;He knew how to reconcile
the gravest studies with pleasantries and wit.&nbsp; His style is
embellished with the ornaments of an adroitly managed
application: he has so much finesse, such an immense fund of
invention, of ideas as novel as ingenious&mdash;so much soft and
delicate irony: he understands so well, whether in verse or
prose, how to sketch with facility a pleasant or ridiculous
subject, that among gay writers there is not one comparable to
him.&nbsp; Nervous and sublime in heroic poetry, graceful in
lyric verse, full of wit and gaiety in his sportive works, his
genius illuminates the weakest subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His poetical effusions have been very much sought after.&nbsp;
Nicholas Antonio, an excellent critic, says, also, that in the
higher walks of poetry, he has force and sublimity.&nbsp; His
luxuriant imagination carried him alternately to both sacred and
profane verse.&nbsp; He wrote divers religious treatises, and
many essays extremely <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>amusing, besides translations in verse
and prose.&nbsp; He published, among other works, the <i>Spanish
Panassus</i>, and the novel known by the name of the
<i>Sharper</i>.</p>
<p>His works have been published in four volumes folio, and in
eleven volumes octavo.&nbsp; They comprise, under the title of
<i>Dreams</i> or <i>Visions</i>, divers works of his, published
at different times, in various places, and with different
titles.</p>
<p>Quevedo, in his old age, was very infirm; and, at an advanced
period of his life, was imprisoned by order of Count
d&rsquo;Olivarez, for a libel upon his administration, in which
situation he remained till the death of the minister.&nbsp; He
died at Villa Nueva de l&rsquo;Infantado, the place of his birth,
on the eighth day of September, 1645.</p>
<h2><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>FIRST
NIGHT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE DEMON.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prayers of the church being
considered as the most efficacious remedies that can be employed
against the possession of the devil, a malady almost invincible,
some wealthy inhabitants of the country had brought into this
city of Seville, one of their relations, who was thus afflicted,
to confide his cure to a religious of renowned sanctity; or, in
other words, for the purpose of having him exorcised.&nbsp; On
the day assigned for this operation, the possessed was carried to
the church of the Cordeliers, which very soon overflowed with
spectators.&nbsp; The gates having been shut before my arrival, I
engaged a religious of my acquaintance to admit me.&nbsp; He
introduced me by the gate of <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the monastery; but I had no sooner
entered the church, than I had reason to repent my curiosity: I
was hustled by the crowd, and overcome with the heat.&nbsp; There
my regards were attracted by an unhappy wretch, of an ill figure,
with wild eyes and dishevelled garments, his hands bound behind
his back, and uttering from time to time the most frightful
yells.&nbsp; There was much impatience testified to behold this
holy priest, of whom I have spoken, whose name was <i>Juan de
Cardanas</i>, father of Barnadino de Cardanas, Capuchin, and
Bishop of Paragua, in America.&nbsp; After the performance of
mass, he found himself so much indisposed, that they were obliged
to postpone the exorcism till another day.&nbsp; I was not sorry;
for, not partaking in the credulity of the people, who often
impute epileptical complaints to the operation of demons, I had
for a long time been desirous of personally verifying those
things they relate concerning the possessions of the devil.&nbsp;
I lost no time in visiting the relations of this unhappy person,
whom I shrewdly suspected had recourse to this adroit method to
rid <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>themselves of the inconvenience of certain pecadilloes
he had been engaged in.&nbsp; I inspired them with sufficient
confidence to obtain permission to visit their lodgings the
following night, with a view of making such an examination as I
should judge proper.&nbsp; I preferred this time to any other,
that I might the better conceal the defeat of my enterprize if it
should not succeed.</p>
<p>The night being come, I was introduced into the chamber of the
possessed whom they had placed upon a bed in such a manner that
he could not rise.&nbsp; The presence of his friends prevented me
from the proposition of certain questions I had meditated.&nbsp;
The following will serve as a sample:</p>
<p>Is it possible to find out the philosopher&rsquo;s stone?</p>
<p>Can the quadrature of the circle be discovered?</p>
<p>Is there an universal panacea for every disease?</p>
<p>Is there among herbs, any simples which can inspire love in
women, or protect from blows and wounds?</p>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>I had
put in writing some other objects of my curiosity; but as it was
not a convenient time to propound them, I began to feel the pulse
of the possessed.&nbsp; It was frequent and elevated: from time
to time his eyes were troubled; and he had convulsive movements,
from which he suffered very much.</p>
<p>After having examined his body, I examined his mind, speaking
to him in Greek, Hebrew, Turkish, Indian, and even in the Mexican
tongue.&nbsp; He answered me always very appropriately in
Spanish, which convinced me that he was in truth possessed with a
devil; for although he spake not all languages, he nevertheless
understood them, which could not naturally happen without study
or travel.&nbsp; His relations assured me he had done neither the
one nor the other.</p>
<p>I demanded of the demon, what name he had in hell?</p>
<p>He answered, &ldquo;that he had no other appellation than that
of the employment which he exercised in the world: that he had
been for a long time in the service of an alguazil, in whom he
inspired all the chicanery and <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>wickedness with which he plagued poor
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us remark here, that the word <i>alguazil</i> is borrowed
from the Moresco tongue, and signifies in Spanish, a constable, a
cryer, a clerk, or other subaltern of justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I to the demon, &ldquo;are you entered
into the body of this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he was himself an alguazil, and a person of a
licentious life.&nbsp; After having been banished from his
paternal home, finding himself necessitous, he associated with
alguazils to extort money, under pretence of executing the
decrees of justice, and in the arrest of bodies, which he often
abandoned for small sums.&nbsp; It was in the execution of this
business, that he stole a silver cup from the house of a country
curate, and subtracted a purse of one hundred ducats from the
pocket of a man, who, for the stuff, was delivered from the hands
of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I asked him if there were many of these people in hell?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very many,&rdquo; answered he: &ldquo;the constables
have neither honour nor conscience; <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>they drive their trade whether they
know any thing of the matter or not: in that particular they
resemble the poets.&nbsp; You shall scarcely find in hell, a
single poet, who will not tell you that he was sent there on
account of the versified lies he told in praise of some
beauty.&nbsp; The poetic spirit hath its origin in the
disposition of the heart, to receive tender impressions: it is
the lover of heroism and romance; and to sustain this character,
must necessarily make use of much artifice.&nbsp; The old poets
serve as secretaries to young lovers; the young ones are
ambitious of blazing as the heroes of their own
compositions.&nbsp; There are so many poets in hell, that it can
hardly fail of aggrandizing their quarter.&nbsp; I wish to speak
in such a manner, that you may comprehend the nature of their
occupations and torments there; but of which you cannot have an
adequate idea, unless I shall here adduce some
examples:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When these authors enter the subterranean abodes, they
look around for a Charon, a dog Cerberus, a Rhadamanthus, a
Pluto, and all the infernal divinities of fable.&nbsp; In <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>place of
that, the demons make them realize, that this is a place much
more horrible than that: but this is not their severest
punishment; they are forced to hear the compositions of other
poets, who are their superiors in talent; then they are tormented
by jealousy; they hate the <i>epigrams</i> of Martial, the
<i>stanzas</i> of Catullus, the <i>odes</i> of Horace, the
<i>beauties</i> of Virgil, the <i>satires</i> of Juvenal, the
<i>comedies</i> of Terence, and the <i>tragedies</i> of
Seneca.&nbsp; It is thus also the historians suffer, when they
listen to the histories of Herodotus, of Titus, Livy, of Sallust,
and of C&aelig;sar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a punishment for these rhymsters, when they
recollect their own works!&nbsp; You cannot imagine the pain they
experience, in finding a felicitous rhyme, a happy epithet, a
just pause, or an harmonious cadence: they are more tormented by
an <i>a</i> or an <i>e</i>, than Tantalus is by thirst, or the
Italians are with their jealousy, when they have Frenchmen at
their houses.&nbsp; And the comic poets, how are they punished,
for having filched away the reputation of so many princesses and
queens of Castile, of Leon, of Arragon, and other places!&nbsp;
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>This is as
fertile a field for them, as all the wars of the Moors of
Granada; but for these larcenies, they suffer sharper agonies as
Christians, than will ever be inflicted upon the barbarians and
Mohammedans, for all their battles and burnings, or upon the
alguazils, even for their violences and exactions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold, in review of the subject,&rdquo; said the
demon, who spake by the mouth of the possessed, &ldquo;there is a
much nearer resemblance between poets and alguazils, than one
would, at a first glance, imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine comparison,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for such a
false spirit as you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;are not poets and
alguazils both thieves? and if you would but confess it, you well
know, that in making these remarks of poets, I speak to a poet,
whom I wish to undeceive.&nbsp; Do you not recollect the old
Spanish proverb, <i>He who never composed two verses</i>, <i>had
no wit</i>; <i>and he who produced four</i>, <i>was a
fool</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;that to be a poet, one
must have an original turn of imagination; and the same
qualification is necessary to a painter: <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>one would
find it very difficult to assume, without merit, the rank of
Apelles and Michael Angelo: but as they cannot justly call these
celebrated artists so generally admired, fools, so neither do I
believe they can accuse of folly the great poets of Spain, of
Italy, of France, of Turkey, of Persia, and of China: for in all
these places they have made verses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and in all these places
there are fools, alguazils, painters, astrologers, jealous or
complaisant husbands, mountebanks, perfumers, plagiaries,
triflers, and slaves of business or pleasure.&nbsp; All these,
under pretext of pleasure or justice, steal, without compunction,
the wealth of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;I now recognize in you
a true demon; you delight to lie, and in crying out that all who
serve the public rob them, you enhance their reputation.&nbsp;
But tell me what robbery a magistrate commits, when he obeys, and
wishes to compel others to obey, the laws of his prince? when, in
fine, he distributes to every one justice?&nbsp; Without justice,
which punishes and avenges, no one could enjoy security in his
own house.&nbsp; A whole city <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>might be given up to pillage, and
become more horrible than the hell you inhabit; a state of things
which must excite a very just indignation among reasonable
people; that is, among those who understand the principles of
order, equity, and natural right.&nbsp; And what a picture would
every family offer!&nbsp; Children opposing themselves to their
fathers, and servants against their masters; brothers would make
laws for brothers, and mothers have no authority over their
daughters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;a superb
description of the disorder which would happen, if the gentlemen
of justice did not make it their duty to become the first
robbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call the pecuniary penalties they impose,
robbery?&rdquo; replied I.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are wisely
established as a check upon avarice and usury, which are the ruin
of families.&nbsp; The fines they impose are regarded sometimes
as extortions; but they are not so; for if the community provided
not for the necessities of all, do you believe that individuals
would furnish of themselves, what is necessary for the republic?
do you believe they would contribute <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>without a demand?&nbsp; There is not
among the officers of government, so much cupidity and bad faith,
as you charge them with.&nbsp; But answer me: without their
assistance, their care, their vigilance, would there be any
security to emperors, kings, popes, and bishops in their beds, or
repose in their dignities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;so bad a
tongue as you believe.&nbsp; I know, truly, all the affairs of
the world, and the state of every condition in republics.&nbsp;
In accusing the most of mankind, I do them no injustice: and
those evils which you say would happen, without the assistance of
those who are appointed to execute the laws, happen in spite of
their wisdom.&nbsp; The worst of it is, they are brought about by
those very persons who are expected to prevent it, and who are
paid for that object.&nbsp; Whence has it arisen that so many
emperors have been killed, so many kings dethroned, so many popes
declared anti-popes, so many bishops dismissed, so many
magistrates suppressed, so many families ruined, so many cities
pillaged, so many provinces reduced to famine?&nbsp; It is by the
ministers of justice, by <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>the overseers of administrations,
that all these things are done, either directly or indirectly:
directly, with a view to profit by the disorder; or indirectly,
from a culpable inertness.&nbsp; How do so many officers of the
long robe contrive to live?&nbsp; They lengthen out their robes
with the pieces they snatch from the officers of the short
robes.&nbsp; A man who goes to law, may be compared to him who
orders a coat: he will have a good coat, but yet not receive all
the stuff he delivered to his tailor.&nbsp; He will take enough
for two pair of sleeves, and two fore parts; he will take twice
as many buttons, twice as much silk, binding, and lining, as is
necessary for one garment; and you shall have but one, when you
ought to have two out of the cloth you purchased.&nbsp; A Spanish
grandee, wishing to have a coat in the French style, purchased as
much cloth as the tailor demanded of him, whom he also left at
liberty to take as much lining, assorted to the colour of the
cloth.&nbsp; After they had taken his measure, he caused them to
call the tailor, and told him that he desired the lining of one
coat to be red, and that of the other yellow.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;How, my lord,&rsquo; said the tailor,
&lsquo;do you wish me to make two coats, when you have given me
stuff but for one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; I do expect it,&rsquo; said the grandee;
&lsquo;and if you do not make them both sufficiently large, I
will put you in a safe place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tailor, who feared the prison, made two garments as
long and large as they ought to be, without purchasing another
shred of cloth.&nbsp; When he brought them home, the lord caused
all the stuff to be measured by an engineer, in his service; he
found that it yet wanted half a quarter of an ell, besides the
little pieces he was forced to cut out for the angles.&nbsp; This
was not all; the Spanish grandee, whose name I can tell you,
which was <i>Don Pedro de Saccaso</i>, wished that the master
tailor should pay him for two garments, which he cabbaged out of
stuff he had delivered him the preceding spring; and as the
tailor cried out at this injustice, the grandee refused to pay
him for the fashion, lining, and trimming of gold of these two
last.&nbsp; Thus you will comprehend,&rdquo; observed the demon,
&ldquo;in what particular the people charged with the <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>administration of justice resemble tailors, and in what
manner they are unjust, even in rendering justice.&nbsp; In their
suits they generally make certain pieces of meadow or vineyard
the object of contention; and if the parties complain of want of
money to pay their fees, they take from them that which they
demand at their tribunal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said I to the demon, &ldquo;there is no
justice upon earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, there is none,&rdquo; added he; &ldquo;and it
is not to-day, that for the first time the complaint has been
uttered.&nbsp; The fable says, that Astrea being come with truth
among men, was obliged to return to heaven, because no person
would receive her.&nbsp; Truth met with the same fate, after
having wandered through the world, sometimes among the Egyptians,
sometimes among the Greeks, sometimes among the Romans, and
sometimes even among the Chinese; she was constrained, at length,
to retire to the house of a poor mute, who yet, by false and
equivocal signs, gave her to understand that he wished to get rid
of her company.&nbsp; She then returned to the place from whence
she <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>came.&nbsp; Justice perceiving they would not tolerate
her in courts, among the abodes of princes, in palaces, or great
cities, fled into the villages, where, however, she did not tarry
a long-time; for the stewards of the lords, that is, those
ignorant stewards who seek but to amass money with which to pay
their charges, gave her chase, and forced her to regain her own
country.&nbsp; The beauty of Astrea, or Justice, resembles that
of the stars&mdash;shining, noble, and worthy of admiration; but
this is only when beheld at a distance; for were you to approach
too near to a star, although it appears to you so diminutive, it
would consume you in an instant.&nbsp; Justice is fair, but she
is proud, austere, rigid, inexorable, and no respecter of
persons: she wishes to be sought and beloved, but she loves not
one friend more than another; and like love, she travels a little
in the rear.&nbsp; Is it possible to find any thing more exact,
more faithful, more laborious, more submissive, more complaisant,
than a violent love?&nbsp; It fails not in the minutest
particular; it knows no concealment; nothing appears difficult to
it; it is always <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>ready to obey, accounting no toil disagreeable; in the
desire, to please, it finds every thing just as it wishes.&nbsp;
Justice does the same in another sense, for she meets with
exactness in the slightest circumstance: she is faithful in the
least things; she is laborious, and fears no pain; she is
submissive to the laws which she imposes; she is complaisant for
herself, and even sometimes appears unjust, so impartial and
rigorous is she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there are many
judges in hell, if what you say is correct, which seems to me
very probable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the demon, &ldquo;they are there in
great numbers, and we have put them in the same place with
thieves and robbers.&nbsp; One circumstance that will surprise
you, is, that their multitude is as considerable as that of the
amorous; although they have among the former, only the men who
were judges: and among the latter, men and women who have loved
once at least in their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wish to give me to understand,&rdquo; said I to
him, &ldquo;that there are many lovers in hell; but can that
be?&nbsp; If men were damned for <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>this passion, no person should be
exempt from your infernal jurisdiction.&nbsp; But this passion
hath one great advantage; it is conformable to the charity that
men owe to one another, and is always accompanied with
repentance, and certain remorse of conscience, when it departs
from those who have been possessed.&nbsp; One sees young girls
even, who repent of their faults.&nbsp; How many religions houses
are founded by penitence! how many old coquettes give themselves
up to devotion! how many men follow their example, after love has
fled with beauty, constitution, and wealth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;how many men and
women, young and old, die in their amours, and count you for
nothing the despair, the chagrin, the secret pains under which so
many lovers have succumbed?&nbsp; Know you not that some
temperaments are so affected by this passion, that they quit it
but with life?&nbsp; If I should relate to you the histories of
both sexes perverted by the perusal of gallant adventures, and
having no other desire in their souls but to experience the like;
if I should <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>cause you to see the occupations of these people in
hell, you would pity some, while you could not help laughing at
the folly of others.&nbsp; You would see young men burning at the
feet of their mistresses; and old ones, who, to please theirs,
are continually shaving themselves, or plucking out their beard,
and who put on bland perukes, to give themselves a youthful
appearance; young girls, who imagine themselves to be Cleopatras,
Artemisias, and Clelias; old coquettes, who paint themselves
continually before their glass, who torment their locks,
tightening the forehead-cloth to efface the wrinkles, and
adjusting to the mouth artificial teeth of ivory or wax: but all
their cases are lost, since there is nothing substantial in the
other world.&nbsp; You would be astonished, if I were to point
out to you all the girls who have taken certain means to hide the
effects of their love sports.&nbsp; It would of necessity be
seen, how many surgeons and physicians follow in their train; and
if any one should inquire why these people are in hell, who have
rendered such universal service, I answer, because they ought not
to <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>afford
assistance to every one.&nbsp; Can they, for instance,&rdquo;
added he, &ldquo;conscientiously administer those remedies to
cause hemorrhages, which end in abortion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as I was about to observe, that the physicians could not
be cognizant of a malady which they would not discover&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; interrupted the demon:
&ldquo;be sure they know well enough, without that; at any rate,
it is their duty to know, or to suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;is there not another
secret you have omitted, of similar effect to the assistance of
the physicians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered: &ldquo;there are the
poisoners, sorcerers, and adroit women, who teach these
mysteries; and there are some in hell who yet continue this
infamous practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have it understood,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;that you are a good devil; a devil of honour and
conscience: you would make a good preacher; the flock would
doubtless edify by your sermons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be persuaded,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that if I preach
not agreeable things, I announce wholesome <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>truths:
believe also, that I have many preachers dependent upon me.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who are they?&rsquo; you inquire.&nbsp; They are those who
preach for their own glory, to establish a reputation, to acquire
celebrity, to gain benefices, and levy contributions upon poor
devotees.&nbsp; They commit wickedness in doing good to others;
in teaching and edifying them.&nbsp; If we lose the hearers
through the instrumentality of their discourses, we gain the
pastors, which is more honourable to us.&nbsp; Finally, I declare
to you, that it is by the order of God, that I speak to you
before all these persons: I warn you, in particular, that you are
lost, unless you abandon all the projects of ambition you have
formed, and unless you renounce poetry, which is at the same time
so agreeable and fatal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw near,&rdquo; said he, to an old man, a relation of
the possessed: &ldquo;restore the three farms you illegally
detain.&nbsp; You, young man, imitate Hercules no more with your
strength and intrigue; Hercules is dead; you may find men who
will kill you.&mdash;You old judge of the village, you have a
very delicate and perilous <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>charge: you were the valet of the
lord of the domain; you have preserved in your new station, the
spirit of servitude, which is not sympathetic with justice.&nbsp;
The petition of your ancient master, you stupid wretch.&nbsp; The
three peasants who have bound and strangled the helpless patient
upon his bed, are those who enjoy the benefit.&nbsp; It is now
six years since the farm-house of their master was consumed with
fire: they ought to be punished for these crimes.&mdash;As to
those young ladies, they would do well not to admit, for the
future, the two strangers, whom they entertain every evening in
their chambers, and whom they introduce by the garden.&nbsp;
Profit, all of you, by what you have now heard: I shall speak to
you no more, for to-morrow the priest comes to exorcise me, and I
shall depart from the body of this subject, it being the will of
God that I should go forth, to attest his power and the glory of
his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon having finished this discourse, took pleasure in
tormenting the possessed, and making him utter moving
cries.&nbsp; I feared the neighbourhood would be alarmed, and <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>that some one
would recognize me in a place where I could not be with
honour.&nbsp; In returning to my house, I reflected upon the
wisdom of God, who draweth good from evil, and causeth demons to
speak as angels of light.&nbsp; The prophet hath also remarked,
that divine Providence disposeth things in such a manner, that
the hands of our enemies can conduce to our welfare.&nbsp; This
is the first possessed I ever saw in the course of my life, and
the first time I ever conversed with a demon.&nbsp; God grant
that I may never behold another, neither in this world, nor in
the world to come!</p>
<h2><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>SECOND
NIGHT<br />
<span class="GutSmall">DEATH AND HER PALACE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are those who affirm that
none but the wicked are subjected to unpleasant thoughts.&nbsp; I
have been acquainted with many persons, but I could never find
one who was not ready to confess, there were moments of sadness
that invaded the soul, the cause of which they could not
explain.&nbsp; These spring, sometimes from a vicious
temperament: the humours mixing themselves with the blood, carry
to the brain those spirits that trace upon the imagination
frightful and whimsical figures, from whence come those
disagreeable dreams and visions that surprise us in the
night.&nbsp; Dreams proceed often from heaven, often from the
devil, and frequently from natural causes; thus we have thoughts
of death, after conversation on the subject, or having read a
book that treated of it.&nbsp; To speak plainly, it seems that
Providence sends us such dreams, for the purpose of forcing our
attention to the consideration of those subjects we are generally
<a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>reluctant
to reflect upon.&nbsp; Such is, without doubt, the origin of this
I have had concerning death.</p>
<p>I read one night before retiring, the verse of Lucretius, one
of the most learned men, and best poets of antiquity.&nbsp; I
found an eminently beautiful passage, where he says, that all
nature, with one consent, elevating her voice, speaks thus to
mankind:&mdash;&ldquo;Why, O mortals, do you groan for such a
length of time, and why are you so sharply afflicted?&nbsp; Why
do you submit to the slavery of flying from death, and the fear
thereof?&nbsp; Why do you continually reflect upon the pleasures
of youth?&nbsp; The enjoyments of this season have passed with
the days you regret, as grain escapes from a sack, from whence it
finds an issue.&nbsp; You are fatigued with the world; why do you
not quit it, as one who returns satisfied from a feast, where the
viands were exquisite, and the pleasure of the highest
flavour?&nbsp; You are convicted of a strange folly: it is in
your power to enjoy tranquillity; why not, then, seize upon
possession?&nbsp; Why fear death, that will render you
invulnerable?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Such
are the sentiments of the poet, and they appear like those of a
saint; but this is nature, or rather, natural reason, teaching us
that death is not so frightful as we are apt to imagine; and I am
not therefore surprised, that heathen philosophers have exhibited
so constant an example of exalted morality.</p>
<p>Likewise I remember what Job has said upon the brevity of
human life, and the swift arrival of death.&nbsp; &ldquo;The life
of man,&rdquo; says this illustrious patriarch, &ldquo;is of
short duration: it is a flower, that before it is scarcely blown,
is despoiled of its leaves: it is a shadow, which flies with the
rapidity of the wind, without remaining stationary a single
moment;&rdquo; and yet, in spite of its brevity, life is subject
to so much calamity, that it is doubtful whether it should not
rather be called misery, than life.</p>
<p>Indulging in these grave meditations, I threw myself upon my
bed, and slept.&nbsp; My spirit was free from external
impressions.&nbsp; I thought there came into the places where my
fancy had transported me, a great multitude of physicians,
mounted upon mules, the housings of which, were clothes of the
dead.&nbsp; In <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>the suit of these physicians, who had an air of sourness
and chagrin, followed a crowd of apothecaries, surgeons, and
young barbers, who carried the drugs or instruments pertaining to
their professions.&nbsp; When the physicians had descended from
their mules, they began to dance a ballet, to the sound of the
mortars and sieves the apothecaries and their adjuncts played
upon.&nbsp; This ballet was interspersed with songs, in which the
physicians took the upper part; the words of one of them were as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Catholicum, rhubarbarae, opiata,
theriaca,<br />
Opoponach, O opium, O laudanum anodinum,<br />
Polychrestum diureticum, senne anisatum.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two young physicians performed the air in these
words:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Recipe, recipe, recipe, recipe senne,<br />
Dragmas duas, dragmas duas, dragmas duas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Semi-dragmum rhei electac,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scrupulum unum polychresti,<br />
Infundantur, percolentur, hauriantur,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hor&acirc; sext&acirc;
matutin&acirc;,<br />
Recipe, recipe, recipe, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two surgeons answered to that, <i>seca</i>; <i>ure</i>; <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>that is to
say, <i>cut</i>, <i>burn</i>; and directly both joined in
chorus&mdash;these repeating <i>recipe</i>, the others
<i>ure</i>, and the last dancing.</p>
<p>This troop having sat, there entered another composed of
newsmongers, and people who followed them to learn what was
transacted abroad in England, France, Holland, Italy, and other
places.&nbsp; After these entered solicitors, stewards of noble
estates, soldiers, priests, and other persons whom I did not
know.&nbsp; This cavalcade was terminated by a woman of monstrous
stature, meagre, pale, and having a very extraordinary
equipage.&nbsp; Her head dress consisted of crowns, tiaras,
electoral bonnets, mitres, red and black hats, hats of straw,
turbans, and bonnets of wool and silk: upon one side of the head,
she had her hair curled and powdered; upon the other, shaven
after the fashion of monks.&nbsp; Her robe was tissue of thread,
wool, and silk, ornamented with trimmings of gold and silver,
chaplets, precious stones, and pearls: she had upon her feet and
legs, shoes of iron, wood, and leather: she bore upon a sceptre,
a shepherd&rsquo;s crook, a scythe, and a great club: she <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>had one eye
open, and the other shut; and carried, pendant from her neck, a
sand box, with crosses of the order of Saint James, of the Holy
Ghost, and the medals of other military orders: her gait was
alternately slow, then quick and precipitate.&nbsp; She
approached my bed, and said, &ldquo;Arise, Chevalier, follow
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, before I follow thee,&rdquo; replied I,
&ldquo;inform me who you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>Death</i>,&rdquo; answered she; &ldquo;follow
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your pleasure, then, that I should
die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no! follow me, and leave behind thy garment; for a
person is not to be clothed when he follows Death.&nbsp; I will
show you my empire, and my subjects.&nbsp; I am the queen of
queens, the empress of sovereigns, the sovereign of the human
race; and the powers of earth are but my inspectors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; exclaimed I, &ldquo;dare you to say the
king of Spain is your inspector? he who possesses so many
territories in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;Follow, follow,&rdquo; said Death; &ldquo;I will
show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately all those who were there, went out in the same
order they had entered: Death following the rear of the
procession, and I following Death.</p>
<p>We traversed vast plains and deserts, which resembled
cemeteries, or fields of battle, covered with dead.&nbsp;
Directly I perceived, at a distance, an immense castle, built in
the antique style; and when I had drawn near, I observed that the
materials were nothing but bones cemented with blood and
apothecaries&rsquo; drugs.&nbsp; The three porters in the court
were very pleasant to the sight.&nbsp; The first resembled a
harlequin assuming divers attitudes, and having upon his habits
the figures of kingdoms and provinces of the earth; in such a
fashion, indeed, that I seemed to look upon a geographical map:
his name was the <i>World</i>.&nbsp; The second, who called
himself the <i>Flesh</i>, was naked, like those figures of
Priapus one sees upon medals.&nbsp; The third was armed, <i>cap a
pie</i>, in gold and silver, like a curassier.&nbsp; They told me
those three guards were the enemies <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>of the world, and the porters of
Death.&nbsp; The pavement of the court was of human sculls, as
well as that of the chambers: these sculls were arranged in such
a manner, that they resembled a chess board; some being white,
and others, having the hair upon them, appeared black.&nbsp; In
the middle of this court was a fountain of tears: the figures
about the basin, represented Uneasiness, Envy, Jealousy, Despair,
Knavery, Sickness, Medicine, War, Revenge, and Love.&nbsp; The
tapestries of the chambers were all upon particular
subjects.&nbsp; One might see in one piece, people contracting
marriage; in another, lawyers pleading a case; in this, merchants
preparing for bankruptcy; in that, <i>honest</i> thieves upon the
grand tour, stripping the peasantry.&nbsp; The others represented
an ecclesiastic, who, dying in his bed, has, in his last moments,
the satisfaction of seeing his house pillaged; a courier riding
from Madrid to Rome, to solicit a benefice; a tiler falling from
the roof of a house; a drunken sailor precipitating himself from
his vessel into the sea; a house burning with such rapidity, that
its master is consumed in <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>the flames; in fine, one might there
perceive every species of human death.</p>
<p>But none of these impressed me with so much horror, as the
paintings in fresco under the grand portico.&nbsp; There were
here servants who strangled their master to obtain his money;
children who assassinated their father, to come more speedily
into possession of his property; subjects who kill their king,
after having pronounced his condemnation; a woman who poisons her
husband; and a mistress who does the same to her lover, to
revenge his infidelity.</p>
<p>In the middle of this gallery, was a colossal figure,
representing Ingratitude, and elevated upon a pedestal; the
relief of which presented on the one side Cruelty, on the second
Infidelity, on the third Interest, on the fourth Ambition.&nbsp;
The base was ornamented with sculptural emblems of sporting
cupids, satyrs, lions, and cats.</p>
<p>After having traversed the whole extent of this apartment,
Death entered into a grand and magnificent hall; the sable
hangings of which were sown with white drops, like the <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>ornaments
commonly seen on monuments in burying places.&nbsp; In this hall
stood a throne composed of dead men&rsquo;s bones, and which
appeared like ivory: four leg bones formed the supporters; two
arms, with their hands, the arms of the seat; a spinal bone, with
those of the thighs, composed the back part; the two pommels
above were two sculls, and the seat was of other bones.&nbsp; It
was ascended by four steps, the first of which was called
<i>infancy</i>, the second <i>youth</i>, the third
<i>manhood</i>, and the fourth <i>old age</i>.&nbsp; Death being
seated, the whole medical corps ranged themselves on either side,
the others being seated at their feet.</p>
<p>Death spake for some time upon the limits of life, and of the
grandeur of her empire: she finished her discourse by observing
that there was but one way of coming into existence, but many
ways of quitting it.&nbsp; She then gave a general order for the
dead to appear, and all at once I saw them fall from the
wainscot, and come from the walls and pavement.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said the queen, &ldquo;each in
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first who commenced, said, &ldquo;I am <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>Romulus,
first king of Rome; my ministers not being able to tolerate my
government, wished to change it; they caused me to be
assassinated, and a report spread, that I had, in their presence,
been translated to heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;C&aelig;sar, first
emperor of the Romans: the senate caused me to perish by the hand
of my adopted son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third, &ldquo;I am the emperor Claudius, poisoned by my
wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fourth, &ldquo;I am Alexander the great; I died in the very
bosom of a debauch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fifth, &ldquo;I am Codrus, king of the Athenians; I died for
my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; exclaimed a sixth, &ldquo;am <i>Charles
the fifth</i>, whose bones my son exhumed, and burnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In like manner appeared many of the illustrious dead, now
confounded with all kinds of people.&nbsp; When they had spoken,
they formed a great circle, in the midst of which I perceived a
large bottle, from whence issued a voice, that said, &ldquo;I am
that famous necromancer, the great magician of Europe.&nbsp; I
caused myself to be cut in pieces by one of <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>my servants,
and shut up in this vessel, expecting my members would re-unite,
and my body be renewed in its pristine youth; I know not whether
the secret was false, or if he neglected to follow strictly my
orders; but after boiling a long time, I formed only a gross,
misshapen, and lifeless mass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You then were of opinion,&rdquo; said death,
&ldquo;that the soul was but a subtle fire; a flame that could
animate your body, and repair itself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the necromancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the vessel again,&rdquo; said Death.</p>
<p>When all the by-standers had been heard, they were required to
put their names upon a great book; and while they were writing, I
saw the bottle move towards me.&nbsp; The necromancer within
immediately commenced a conversation with me; inquiring,
&ldquo;who reigns in Spain?&nbsp; Does Venice yet exist?&nbsp;
What is the news in France?&nbsp; Are the Calvinists constantly
triumphant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered him, &ldquo;Philip IV. reigns in Spain; Venice is
still beautiful, rich, and <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>powerful: the Calvinists and their
king are always invincible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then besought me to break the bottle.&nbsp; As I hesitated,
not being without certain qualms of fear, it swelled, and burst
of itself.&nbsp; I then saw what it had contained expand into a
human form, and rising up, resumed the discourse in this
manner:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it is impossible for me to return again into the
world, place us henceforth among the dead magicians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the place of the bottle, there appeared an old man with a
great head and a long beard: he was of a grave mein, and held a
globe in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Nestradamus, that great
French astrologer, who predicted, during my life, every thing
that has since happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;are you he that composed
those famous centuries, which, after death, were found in your
tomb?&nbsp; Resolve me, I pray you, one of your prophecies now in
my mind:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The sign of Aries shall the world
command;<br />
Taurus shall rule the waves and solid land;<br />
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Mother and
sire the virgin shall deceive,<br />
The mother&rsquo;s breasts the tender twins shall
leave.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the astrologer, &ldquo;is as clear as
the light of day; and signifies, that married men shall
frequently resemble rams: the love of woman, represented by the
bull, shall mingle itself with affairs of every kind; the
daughter divert herself spite of the advice of her father, and
the sons laugh at maternal expostulation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this, what is its signification?&rdquo; demanded
I:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mothers soon shall children bear,<br
/>
Who to name no sire shall dare;<br />
None of all the babes they bear,<br />
E&rsquo;er shall lack a father&rsquo;s care.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That is equally easy of explanation.&nbsp; I wish to
convey the idea, that many children shall call those fathers, who
are not so; and shall have fathers whom they will never
discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would have departed, after explaining these two prophecies;
but I stopped him, entreating him only to tell me the meaning of
this last:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Before another year is born,<br />
Many a goose quill shall be worn;<br />
Many a quill the ether bear,<br />
Many a man shall dance in air;<br />
Men shall sorely rue the attack,<br />
Of grey goose quill and Doctor Quack;<br />
Merchants be in bankrupt plight,<br />
Nobles turn to blackguards quite;<br />
Province, city, town, and village,<br />
Soon shall soldiers sack and pillage;<br />
Lads and lasses soon shall try,<br />
What darkness hides from every eye;<br />
No more shall widows&rsquo; weeds endure;<br />
The cloister virgins shall immure.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;That signifies,&rdquo; said Nostradamus, who was in
haste to depart, &ldquo;that one half of the world shall pillage
the other; the people of justice shall rob by their pen; false
witnesses will support themselves by hanging upon their skirts;
the physicians will kill with physic, and be well paid for it;
the merchants thrive by bankruptcy; nobles shall be ruined by
their stewards; the soldiers will lay all under contribution;
children shall rob one another; widows contract new nuptials, and
to enjoy the portions of their daughters, make <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>nuns of
them.&nbsp; Let go!&rdquo;&mdash;and he hastily left me.</p>
<p>I then perceived before me a good old man, of a very sad
aspect, who demanded if I was dead?</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered I; &ldquo;living, and at your
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I expect a favour of
you.&nbsp; You must know, I am called <i>They</i>.&nbsp; I also
bear the appellation of <i>Somebody</i>, of <i>Another</i>, of a
<i>certain Personage</i>, of <i>Author</i>, and of <i>I know
who</i>.&nbsp; While I lived in the world, I was accused of
having said and done every thing which could not be traced: if a
false report was circulated, it was <i>they</i> who had broached
it: if any one was found assassinated in the high way, it was
<i>they</i> who had killed him: if there was a man with a bad
face, this was <i>somebody</i>: if it was imprudent to name a
person in an affair, they called him <i>a certain person</i>: if
a writer advanced bold things, this was an <i>author</i>, who had
spoken on the first impression: and, finally, when the author was
entirely concealed, it was <i>I know who</i>, that had said or
acted thus and <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>so.&nbsp; All this time I neither said nor did any
thing; I appeared no where; I knew not what passed, and kept
house both day and night; the chagrin of seeing myself in so bad
repute, fairly put an end to my existence.&nbsp; I demand,
therefore, of you, to vindicate me to your friends, and those
persons over whom you have any influence, that they may not in
future charge me with any thing; for, since I am dead, I can of
course have nothing more to do with the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I promised the old gentleman I would remember what he desired,
and he retired contented.&nbsp; At this moment a young woman
coming up to me, fell upon my neck, exclaiming,</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear &AElig;neas, have you at length arrived!&nbsp;
I have for a long time wished to see you.&nbsp; Virgil hath
spoken very illy of you: he has published a history of our loves,
which we knew nothing of: I have sought you among all the dead,
without being able to find you; but I know, from your air, that
you are &AElig;neas; for, as you have been the greatest and most
illustrious of heroes, so here you surpass all the dead in
demeanour and beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>As the
surprise I felt at this unmerited compliment prevented answer,
she continued to speak, and embraced me so vehemently, that I was
compelled to cry out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace, there!&rdquo; commanded the officer of the
chamber, who was called <i>Silence</i>.</p>
<p>I still continued to bawl out; and said to Madame Dido,
&ldquo;O Queen of Carthage! will you not be undeceived?&nbsp; I
am Don Francisco de Quevedo de Villegas, Chevalier of the order
of Saint James!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behold!&rdquo; replied the queen, &ldquo;behold this
drunkard, who, being a Trojan, would fain pass himself off for a
Spaniard!&nbsp; Go, pious &AElig;neas; Virgil hath done thee no
great wrong in describing thee as thou art.&nbsp; Where is thy
Palladium? thy nurse? thy son Ascanias? where are thy companions?
why are you here without attendants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be not disquieted,&rdquo; said I: &ldquo;address
yourself to Charon; he would know you as well as &AElig;neas, who
abandoned you in Africa; that was a meet punishment for your
prudery: but you have not yet been able to forget a man, who
surrendered his native city to the <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Greeks, and fled from his ruined
country.&nbsp; You are a victim of love!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said she, retiring, &ldquo;are very
credulous!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer again commanded silence, and before I had time to
add any thing more, I saw approaching a dead person of great
size, with horns upon his head, and who ran towards me as though
he was going to strike with them.&nbsp; I stretched out my arms
to defend myself, and perceiving near me a large fork, that
supported the tapestry, I took it in my hand, and firmly awaited
his onset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recognize,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Don Diego
Moreno, whom you have called in your poems Signor
Cornuto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;and to convince you, that
I neither fear you, living nor dead, take in advance a blow with
this fork;&rdquo; and at that endeavoured to run him through, but
his bones were too hard.&nbsp; Moreno then gave me a blow with
his head, and casting himself upon me, threw me down: I stuck to
his sides, inserting my fingers into the openings beneath the
sternum, and as he arose, came <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>up with him.&nbsp; This noise causing
considerable confusion in the assembly, I saw coming upon me, a
great number of the dead, armed in the same manner with Moreno;
and as they pressed upon one another, each anxious to pass his
neighbour, their bones made a very curious clicking.&nbsp; In the
mean time, others marshalled themselves in front, to protect me
from their assault.</p>
<p>During these transactions, Death sat upon her throne in
silence, attentive only to the inscription of her subjects names;
and as the secretaries happened to finish at a moment when there
was a slight cessation in our tumult, the officer
cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peace&mdash;listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I seized this occasion to demand justice of the queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I supplicate your sovereign majesty,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;to do me justice on Diego Moreno, who has insulted me in
this palace; striking me with his horns, knocking me down, and
exciting against me the whole host of cuckolds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What defence do you make to this accusation,
Moreno?&rdquo; asked the queen.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;Mighty and wan princess,&rdquo; replied he,
&ldquo;behold the man who caused me to pass in the world as a
Vulcan, or a faun: I have always lived pleasantly with my wife,
never objecting to the French method, of receiving at her house
priests, soldiers, lawyers, politicians, merchants, and strangers
of every country.&nbsp; As the house had a great deal of good
company, where nothing was wanting, although my wife was no
expense to me, I found it very convenient; and because I profited
by the follies of others, because I made that a part of my
revenue, because I took advantage of my wife&rsquo;s friends, to
amass an estate for my children, the chevalier Quevedo derided
me, rendering me ridiculous by his poems, and representing me as
the prince of accommodating husbands; he called me a ram, and
made me one of the signs of the zodiac: not content with that, he
even comes hither, and strikes me with a fork.&nbsp; I demand
that he should be retained here, and that he be put in a
situation during his slumbers, that will effectually prevent his
waking.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>&ldquo;Which of the two began the affray?&rdquo; said
Death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; answered Moreno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We ordain</i> then, that the name and memory of
Moreno shall never be forgotten in Spain; that his grave shall be
opened, and his compatriots, if any yet exist, shall make a
pilgrimage, to render homage to his ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, they called over the names of the dead; and as
they were called, they answered <i>adsum</i>, &ldquo;I am
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hearing my own name pronounced, which was also
that of my uncle and god-father, I answered, as the others,
<i>adsum</i>; at which mistake Moreno taking advantage to laugh
at me, I hit him a heavy blow with my fist upon his head; but I
hurt myself more than him, for I almost broke my fingers.&nbsp;
Moreno cast himself upon me; I stood firm, and thus we were again
engaged in a new combat.&nbsp; They endeavoured to separate us,
but I had entangled my hands in such a manner, in the bones of
his arms, that I could not withdraw them; and as they pulled me
on one side, and him on the other, it gave me such exquisite
pain, that I awoke, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>happy and thankful to find myself in my bed.&nbsp; I
reviewed in my mind all I had seen and heard, and which is here
reported.</p>
<p>This vision made such a forcible impression upon my
imagination, that I yet seem to behold the palace of death, the
audience of the dead, and Moreno pouncing upon me: finally, I
made many reflections upon what I had seen.&nbsp; It is but too
true, that all mankind must die; that we are surrounded with
constant peril; that there is but one thing that can insure a
tranquil death, and that is, a blameless life.&nbsp; But to live
well, one must often think of death.&nbsp; I believe the dream I
have just rehearsed, was inspired by heaven; for otherwise I
should hardly have thought upon my latter end, not even when my
life was peculiarly exposed amidst wars and battle.&nbsp; At
present, I reflect without ceasing; I have totally abandoned
trifling and poetry, which are synonymous; and, thanks to God,
have more satisfaction in reading books of devotion, than
romances and histories.</p>
<h2><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>THIRD
NIGHT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LAST JUDGMENT.</span></h2>
<p>I have read in Homer, that dreams come from Jupiter; and that
this cannot be doubted, especially when they regard things of
importance.&nbsp; I verily believe those of kings and princes
proceed from on high: but I will substitute the true God in place
of Jupiter, who is but a fabulous divinity.&nbsp; The vision I
had last year, could not have been derived from any other than a
heavenly source.&nbsp; Behold the events that passed: I was
reading the book of the blessed Hypolitus, which treats of the
end of the world, and of the coming of God, to judge the quick
and the dead, the just and the unjust.&nbsp; I fell asleep over
this book, sitting in a large easy chair.&nbsp; All at once, I
thought I saw a noble young man, of extraordinary beauty, flying
through the air, having at his mouth a trumpet, that sounded far
and wide.&nbsp; When he had made five or six great circuits, I
perceived soldiers starting from <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>their graves, full of courageous
animation, thinking they heard the signal of battle.&nbsp; Upon
the other hand, the misers started up, in terror, lest thieves
had come to rob.&nbsp; The courtiers imagined that they enjoyed
the agitations of the ring, or of a carousal.&nbsp; No one had
the least idea that it announced the last judgment.&nbsp; I was
strongly tempted to laugh at seeing the maimed, the one-eyed, the
blind, seeking the one their arms or legs, and the other their
eyes.&nbsp; I was equally amused, to perceive the clerks
unwilling to resume their heads, the slanderers their tongues,
and the old women their throats.</p>
<p>After all these had come forth, and arrived in an immense and
smooth valley, very proper for so grand a spectacle, I saw appear
people of every art and trade; likewise the men of letters, among
whose ranks there appeared a very considerable
embarrassment.&nbsp; Each community placed itself separately;
each religion had also its sectaries apart: such as Christians,
Jews, Mahometans, Pagans, Heretics, and Schismatics.&nbsp; All
the people being classed and placed, a judge presented <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>himself,
accompanied by twelve counsellors, who seated themselves near his
throne; beneath them were the prophets, in the capacity of
advocates.&nbsp; Immediately a loud flourish of trumpets was
heard, as if an army of cavalry approached, and legions of
shining angels appeared, who poised themselves with their wings,
above those men to whom they had been guardians.&nbsp; That done,
the archangel Michael, came and placed himself at the foot of the
throne, upon which the judge was seated, having in his hand a
naked sword, and beneath his feet a prostrate devil, as he is
represented in churches, and called the auditors each by his
name.</p>
<p>Adam answered first; he was accused by his demon, with having
eaten an apple, contrary to the commands of his God; with having
neglected the gifts he had received at his creation; with having
cast the blame upon his wife; with having had a bad son, and of
other faults which I do not distinctly remember.&nbsp; But I very
well recollect, that these reproaches produced such confusion in
him, that he could answer nothing: his good angel <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>answered for
him; he confessed the matters of which his party was accused; he
set forth the excess and duration of his penitence; the agonies
he had suffered from the decree that involved his posterity, the
goods which God had seen born of his sin; in fine, he pleaded
with such ability, that his client was acquitted.</p>
<p>When they called Judas, Herod, and Pilate, their crimes were
so glaring, that they could neither defend themselves, nor would
any angel speak in their favour; and they were accordingly
condemned.&nbsp; After them, were examined the most noted
heretics, and neither could they obtain pardon.</p>
<p>Presently there appeared a number of pagan philosophers, among
whom, I distinguished the seven sages of Greece, with Plato,
Zeno, Socrates, Aristotle, and others: there were also Mercury,
Trismegistus, an Egyptian, Sanconianthon, a Phenician, and
Confucius, a Chinese.&nbsp; The majority of these avowed, that
they had adored no other than the true God.&nbsp; The judge
demanded, if they had given him all the glory, and rendered to <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>him all the
honour that was his due.&nbsp; They answered nothing, and were
not exculpated.</p>
<p>The corps of artists next presented themselves: some of them
were justified, but by far the greatest part were condemned for
larcenies, frauds, surprises, and infidelities.</p>
<p>The men of letters then had their turn: many of them were
charged with having taught and written contrary to their real
opinions.&nbsp; The poets made every one laugh, on asserting,
that when they spoke of Jupiter, of gods and goddesses, they
meant the true God, saints, and saintesses: that they had never
seriously deified the king of Candia, nor the first king of
Egypt, nor the queens of Cyprus and Sicily; that if these people
had become idolaters, they ought to take the blame upon
themselves.&nbsp; Virgil in particular, was examined very
minutely upon that passage of his poems, where he invokes the
Sicilian muses: he pretended to have spoken of the birth of the
Messiah; but he was answered that he must then have been in the
soul of the Son of Pollio.&nbsp; Orpheus was accused by the
ladies of Thrace, <a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>because he had taught men a love that did not concern
them.</p>
<p>The clerks, lawyers, and constables, applied to Saint <i>Ives
de Chartres</i>, to plead their cause; but he refused, saying, he
had never been a robber, but had always pursued the cause of
truth and justice, and that they had not acted in that
manner.&nbsp; The devils also accusing them of having often been
corrupted by presents, and the solicitations of women; few among
them escaped.</p>
<p>After these, the physicians, surgeons, and apothecaries, were
brought forward: they justified themselves by the authority of
Hippocrates, Galen, and Paracelsus; but those whom they summoned,
mocked at them, and their allegations.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who are
they,&rdquo; demanded those eminent physicians, &ldquo;who have
cited us, and presume to shelter themselves behind our
example?&rdquo;&nbsp; The unhappy accused then sought the
assistance of their two saints, <i>Come</i> and <i>Damiens</i>;
but they refused to defend homicides, and judgment of
condemnation was accordingly pronounced.</p>
<p>As it is out of my power to follow all the <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>judgments in
their order, I shall report only those that appeared most worthy
of note.&nbsp; A fencing master, being unwilling to approach the
bar, an angel extended his arm to seize him; but the master,
throwing himself into an attitude, made a fanciful push towards
the angel, telling him at the same time, that from such a thrust
with the small sword, he would have received a mortal wound; that
all those who had taken lessons of him, never failed to kill
their man, and that he himself had always been victorious, till
he met with his physician.&nbsp; At last, constrained by force,
he was brought forward and convicted of all the homicides
committed by his scholars, who, confident in their skill, had
often sought quarrels, for the purpose of putting their theory in
practice.&nbsp; For these offences it was decreed that he should
go into hell in a perpendicular line.&nbsp; &ldquo;Zounds,&rdquo;
said the master, &ldquo;I will go as I may, but not in a
perpendicular line; I am not a mathematician.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;do you wish to
go?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;In making leaps backward before the mouth
of hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Not quite so much subtlety,&rdquo;
said the devil; &ldquo;I will <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>make you obedient;&rdquo; and he
carried him into the abyss, that was at the extremity of the
valley.</p>
<p>This man gave place to a great astrologer, whom his angel
endeavoured to bring before the tribunal: he was loaded with
almanacs, globes, spheres, astrolabes, compasses, quadrants,
rules, and papers, filled with astronomical calculations.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said he to the angel; &ldquo;the
last judgment has not yet arrived, because the constellation of
Saturn, and that of fear, have not yet finished their courses; it
ought not to arrive in less than twenty-four thousand years; for
God hath not created the universe and the celestial globes, not
to permit them to finish their journeys; and there is yet no
appearance of an union of the sun and stars, to set fire to the
world, as must necessarily happen at the last day.&nbsp; I
appeal, then, in advance, against all other
judgments.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;March,&rdquo; said the devil,
&ldquo;or I shall carry you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Carry me,&rdquo;
said the astronomer, &ldquo;into the kingdom of the moon; I will
reward you well; I am curious to see those beautiful countries,
we discover <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>with our telescopes; the countries of Galileo, of
Copernicus, of Tycho Brahe, and other celebrated astronomers, who
are gone to dwell in the moon, and who have bestowed their names
upon those regions they inhabit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The discourse of
this fool, did not prevent an accusation before the judge, of
irreligion, superstition, and other vices which he could not
dispute.</p>
<p>I then saw an operator, who, imagining himself to be in a
proper place for vending his drugs, praised the properties of his
orrietan, and the virtues of his counter-poisons.&nbsp; When he
came before his judges, he was desirous of trying some
experiments, and demanded if he should use realgal, arsenic, or
the blood of toads and spiders.&nbsp; The devil, who stood at his
side, asked him if he had any fire ointment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are you in want?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is yourself that will soon need it,&rdquo; answered the
devil; &ldquo;because you have cheated so many people with your
lies and knaveries.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was confounded at this
discourse, and was led away to hell.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>When
they were close by, he said to the devil, &ldquo;I perceive the
jest; you keep here the feast of Peter; I am not so much alarmed
as you think: let us go, let us go,&rdquo; said he, entering into
hell, &ldquo;let us go and see Don Peter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There then came a troop of tailors, the chief one of whom
diverted me much: he had a pair of scissors in his hand, and a
long slip of parchment, with which he took measure for
garments.&nbsp; Perceiving me, he stepped up and proposed to make
me a coat in the French fashion: I assured him that I had no need
of such a garment; but he ran round me, insisting upon taking my
measure.&nbsp; I observed that it was then no time to transact
such business; that he was before his judge, and had better
invoke his guardian angel: but the angel advised him to plead his
own cause, as he could not conscientiously defend a case so
obvious.&nbsp; &ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; answered the tailor,
&ldquo;I engage to give you a suit every year, gratis; for it is
doubtless for lack of tailors, that you angels go always
naked.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Without dispute;&rdquo; replied the
angel, &ldquo;for there is not a single tailor in <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; resumed
the tailor; &ldquo;I go then in person, to defend myself and
brethren.&nbsp; We have never stolen more stuff than we could put
into our eyes; we threw the useless pieces into the street; we
have always measured the trimmings of gold and silver, after
finishing the suit, and took no more than was absolutely
necessary.&nbsp; As to the rest, our trade is one inculcating
mercy; to clothe the naked, and furnish a defence from the cold;
meritoriously following the gospel precept: thus have we acted,
besides suffering patiently the prejudice the embroiderers have
done us in making the habits of the church.&nbsp; I demand that
Saint Martin, archbishop of Tours, who gave the moiety of his
mantle to a poor beggar, should be heard in our
behalf.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Saint Martin,&rdquo; said one of the
angels, &ldquo;hath never been the protector of tailors; and so
far would he be from defending you, that he would condemn
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! well,&rdquo; said the tailor,
&ldquo;oblige us by being yourself our interlocutor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;I consent,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;and will quickly
expose the tricks of your trade: the tailors have in their shops
<a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>a private
drawer, which they call <i>the eye</i>; and it is there they
deposit what they steal.&nbsp; The under part of their table and
its immediate neighbourhood, they call the <i>street</i>; and
here they cast the superfluous stuffs: so when this master cheat
asserted, he had never stolen more than might have been contained
in his eye, or that he threw into the street the waste pieces of
cloth, or stuff, it was equivalent to saying, that, he had never
taken more than might be put into his drawer, or beneath his
table.&nbsp; As to the trimmings of gold and silver, it is true,
they are measured upon the garment, but then it is found after
the chain of binding is cut, that it stretches very easily.&nbsp;
When he said that his trade was merciful and charitable, he spoke
the truth, if these are the attributes of thieves: but I demand,
if, without pillaging cloth, they could ornament chambers with
rich tapestry, build fine houses, give portions to their
daughters, bear the extravagancies of their children, give
sumptuous entertainments, and enjoy all the luxuries of
life?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; simultaneously exclaimed
the whole assembly.&nbsp; The corps of tailors <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>was
accordingly condemned, and they were precipitated into the
abyss.</p>
<p>When all the judgments had been pronounced, the judge, his
counsellors, the angels, and the elect, launched forth into the
air, and ascended to heaven, amid an harmonious concert of
trumpets, and other instruments.&nbsp; Those who remained in the
valley, and had not been sent to hell, were in despair, because
they were not able to follow the array of the blessed.&nbsp; When
the celestial throng had wholly disappeared, a most horrid tumult
ensued: the planets fell from their orbits, the mountains came
together with dreadful washings, the earth gaped, and all who
remained fell into the abyss, uttering such piercing shrieks that
I was seized with terror.&nbsp; I awoke, and felt the most lively
pleasure to find myself out of danger.&nbsp; I reflected
afterwards upon the multitude of the guilty, and the small number
adjudged innocent.&nbsp; Oh, how necessary it is, that all the
living should experience a similar vision, that they might be
witnesses of the disorder, of the despair, and torments of the
damned.&nbsp; It would suffice also to exemplify <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>the piteous
confusion, which can neither be expressed nor comprehended, that
will not fail to happen at the last day.&nbsp; I am not now
surprised that the Israelites, at the foot of Mount Sinai, could
not endure the noise of the thunder that resounded from its
summit.</p>
<h2><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>FOURTH
NIGHT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE COUNTRY AND THE PALACE OF
LOVE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the fourth day of January, I had
passed the evening in the company of some beautiful and amiable
young ladies.&nbsp; Contrary to my usual custom of retiring at an
early hour, I sat up late, amusing myself and trifling with these
ladies, which brought to my imagination, during sleep, the most
delightful images.&nbsp; I fancied I heard a voice, which recited
these verses, borrowed by Virgil from Theocritus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What phrensy, shepherd has thy soul
possess&rsquo;d?<br />
Thy vineyard lies half prun&rsquo;d, and half undress&rsquo;d,<br
/>
Quench, Corydon, thy long unanswered fire;<br />
Mind what the common wants of life require.<br />
On willow twigs employ thy weaving care;<br />
And find an easier love, though not so fair.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am ignorant by what paths I was conducted, but I suddenly
found myself in a most delightful country, such as the poets are
wont to describe the isle of Cyprus and the gardens of Love; it
was bordered by two little rivers, <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>one of which was sweet, and the other
bitter water.&nbsp; These waters, conducted by a subterranean
canal, united in a great basin of white marble, placed in the
middle of a garden.&nbsp; After I had promenaded a little, to
admire the beauty of the trees, and respire the perfume of the
flowers, I entered into a long and magnificent walk, planted with
citrons and oranges: upon each side were arbours, adorned
interiorly with paintings and sculpture, and surrounded without
by jessamines, laurels, honeysuckles, and other shrubs.&nbsp; At
the extremity of this walk, there appeared, in perspective, a
large and superb edifice, which was called the <i>Palace of
Love</i>.&nbsp; The porticoes were of the Doric order: upon the
pedestals, the bases, the columns, the cornices, the friezes, the
architraves, and the chapters, were, in half relief, little
cupids, who disported themselves in all sorts of gambols.&nbsp;
There was written upon the gate in letters of gold upon a black
ground, this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Behold the palace of the happy,<br />
The abode of lovers.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The custody of the gate was committed to <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>a woman of a
nymph like appearance: her name was Beauty.&nbsp; She was tall
and well proportioned: her features were regular, and her whole
appearance so seducing, that her name seemed to answer her
description exactly.&nbsp; Her garments were magnificent, but
their transparency permitted the sight of charms that eclipsed
the light.&nbsp; The whiteness of the snow would have yielded to
the whiteness of her bosom: in a word, she had about her that, I
know not what, of enchantment, which no pencil could delineate,
or language describe.&nbsp; She made me so gracious a salutation,
that I was emboldened to request of her a conductor, to show me
the apartments of the palace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Address yourself,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to the
Introducer; he is lodged in this wing,&rdquo; motioning me with
her right hand to the left side of the edifice.</p>
<p>I thanked her, and went in quest of the Introducer, who was at
the same time the Inspector of this smiling country.&nbsp; I
perceived in him an old man with a long beard.&nbsp; He received
me with great civility; and having signified to him my desire, he
told me that he <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>would himself conduct me to the foot of the throne of
the Queen.&nbsp; He girded upon his thigh instead of a sword,
along sharp scythe.&nbsp; He took for a cravat, an hour-glass
with golden sand; and for a hat, a bonnet of mercury with
wings.&nbsp; To do me honour, he preceded me.&nbsp; We entered
immediately into the apartment of the girls, which was separate
from that of the women who have arrived at maturity.&nbsp; In
perambulating these chambers, I saw all these girls singularly
occupied: there were some who wept with jealousy against the
widows; others were filled with inquietudes, not daring to avow
the love with which the other sex had inspired them.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My lover,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;is extremely cold; he is
too timid; O that the same privilege of declaring our
inclinations was permitted to us, as to the other sex!&nbsp; I
would speak a language to him, which he should
respond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of them read or wrote letters; they used a great deal of
paper in that business; for in order to say that they would not,
they destroyed, recommenced, destroyed again, and recomposed the
same lines; they desired <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>that their words should have a double
meaning, and that their lovers should understand that, which they
had no intention of making them comprehend.&nbsp; Others, placed
before their mirrors, studied their gestures, giving expression
to their features, endeavouring to put grace into their smile,
and gaiety into their laugh.&nbsp; Certain of them, plucked the
hair from the chin and eye-brows; others applied plaster to their
faces; many of them, to cause paleness and a more interesting
appearance in the eyes of their lovers, ate plaster, jet,
charcoal, and Spanish wax, contrary to the custom of the French,
who diligently avoid those substances that can give them a yellow
appearance, as saffron, pepper, salt, and every thing
provocative.</p>
<p>From this apartment, I passed into that of the married
women.&nbsp; Some of them grieved at the jealousy of their
husbands, and others at the avarice of theirs.&nbsp; There were
those who caressed their spouses, that they might the more easily
deceive them: there were others who concealed money from their
knowledge, to purchase finery, or make presents to <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>their
gallants: there were others who made vows, and projected
pilgrimages, to the end that they might enjoy the company of
those whom they could not otherwise see: and others, who spoke
continually of the sweetness, of the handsome mein, and good
proportions of their confessors.&nbsp; Some there were, who said
that there could be no pleasure more consummate, than in
revenging ones self upon ones husband; some, also, that the most
insupportable torment to a married woman, was to be obliged to
answer the caresses of a husband whom she did not love: many,
that the pleasantest hour was that passed at the play with a
gallant.&nbsp; There were those too among them, who had taken
their waiting maids into confidence, and strove to engage them in
their interests by every indulgence.</p>
<p>Contiguous to this place, was a spacious pavilion where we
found the widows.&nbsp; Some of this class affected austerity and
modesty; but others gave themselves up to all sorts of
folly.&nbsp; Many were exceedingly joyous, although they were in
mourning: many were sad, because black did not become them; <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>many, on the
contrary, judged that crape was their chiefest ornament, and that
it served best to exhibit the brilliant whiteness of their
complexion.&nbsp; The old widows wished to imitate the young,
while these sought to improve their time to the best
advantage.&nbsp; Those who exhibited the most lassitude, were
generally young widows, who waited with impatience for the year
of mourning to expire; but others spent their time cursing the
memory of their husbands, who had prohibited second nuptials.</p>
<p>I was soon weary of my visit to this apartment; folly and
libertinism were not to my taste.&nbsp; My conductor perceiving
it, took me by the arm, and said that he would show me the
amorous devotees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, for all that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;love and
devotion can hardly agree; however, let us see all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho,&rdquo; said Time; &ldquo;yes, true devotion;
but know that it is as rare to see true devotees, as women
without love: these same true devotees have at least those with
whom they are not much upon their guard, and when they are not
observed, cannot resist the seductions <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>of a handsome and assiduous cavalier:
in default of that they take their confessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus conversing, we entered into the apartment of the
devotees.&nbsp; Almost all prayed to God, either for the health
or the return of a lover: many to be soon married, or to be
always handsome, or for death to rid them of a rival.&nbsp; Some
of these women performed their devotions while waiting for their
gallants.</p>
<p>As the character of these women had in it nothing agreeable to
me, I besought my conductor to lead me to the abodes of the men;
the more, because I would hear from thence a concert of
instruments; he showed me the entrance into their quarter.&nbsp;
I found in the first hall, a great number of fiddlers and pipers,
who concerted a serenade for the following night.&nbsp; In the
second, I saw men who made their toilets, and arrayed themselves
in new garments, of the favourite colours of their
mistresses.&nbsp; In the third, were those who prepared to send
presents to their fair friends.&nbsp; In the fourth, were lovers
who put themselves in attitudes to fight in duel with their
rivals.&nbsp; In the fifth, they read novels, or made extracts <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>from
them.&nbsp; In the sixth, were the old fellows who were mad for
love.&nbsp; In the seventh, were young men sick, and who dared
not disclose the causes of their indisposition.&nbsp; In the
eighth, married men did that for their mistresses, which the
wives did for their gallants.&nbsp; In the ninth, widowers
imitated the actions of the widows.&nbsp; In the tenth, in fine,
the gentlemen of the church showed themselves more amorous than
the men of the world, because they are addicted to less general
dissipation, and have fewer opportunities for the gratification
of their inclinations.</p>
<p>As I came out of this place, I heard a clock striking with a
heavy sound, and reverberating throughout the palace.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said I to Opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;marks the hour for private
conversation and appointments; enter into this large hall; you
shall soon see a great deal of the world: wait for me, until I
shall return to conduct you out of the palace, for otherwise you
will not be able to find your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went into the hall, in which were a great <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>number of
seats.&nbsp; The magnificence of the tapestry, which represented
the fabulous metamorphoses, corresponded with the style of the
edifice: at the extremity was a throne of ivory, silver, and
gold, under a canopy enriched with pearls and precious
stones.&nbsp; When the persons of both sexes had entered and sat,
a woman of a strange figure, and clad in a very whimsical manner,
placed herself upon the throne; they called her Passion.&nbsp;
Another woman, whom they called Folly, sat near her, and spake as
if she was the queen&rsquo;s chancellor.&nbsp; Forthwith this
princess began to set forth the advantages that had been gained
over the empire of Reason, who had been for a long time her
enemy.&nbsp; While she was speaking, a stately dame named
Jealousy, promenaded through every part of the hall: she inspired
some with fear, and made others laugh; at length she came near
me, and said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not without some purpose, you are here and
separate from the rest; perhaps you are more
fortunate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I answered, that &ldquo;I found myself there without any
particular design.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>replied she,
retiring; and from time to time she revisited the place where I
was, to see if some girl did not come to join me.&nbsp; As I
divined her thoughts, I strove to give her uneasiness; I affected
to exhibit the same myself; I looked anxiously from one side to
the other, as if I had expected some one.&nbsp; I remarked this
woman made the same motions.</p>
<p>When the queen had finished her discourse, many persons
presented petitions, which were all forthwith granted.&nbsp;
After that, the princess announced to all her votaries, that she
granted them the propitious moment, and retired.&nbsp;
Immediately each one presented his hand to his partner, and
hastened from the hall.&nbsp; Some went into chambers, and others
walked about.&nbsp; There was no one but Jealousy remaining in
the chamber where I was; she promenaded about the hall,
murmuring:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall see,&rdquo; said she: &ldquo;I will watch; I
will discover: I will hinder: I will talk: I shall not be
inactive.&nbsp; Ah, good,&rdquo; cried she to me with vivacity;
&ldquo;what do you do here? depart, I wish to close the
gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I expected my guide, I was not willing <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>to go out,
lest I might lose myself in this vast edifice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wish to wait here for Opportunity,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;who
ordered me to remain in this hall, till he should come to rejoin
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon not,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;upon this old
dotard; he will not return; he is gone upon the stream, with the
others: believe me; quit this place:&rdquo; and thus speaking,
she took me by the shoulders, and thrust me out.</p>
<p>I walked upon the garden terrace until I saw descend a silken
ladder.&nbsp; I immediately thought that this was an invitation
made to me, and thinking of nothing but the novelty of the
adventure, I ascended.&nbsp; I entered by a window into a
chamber, where I saw a man and a young girl sitting at table:
they were both surprised at my presence, but especially the young
cavalier, who remained immovable: presently recovering himself,
and addressing himself to the lady:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ingrate, this is then the manner in which you betray
me! you have then certainly two lovers, and perhaps
fifty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, sir!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I swear to you I know
not this gentleman; assuredly he has <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>made a mistake, in taking my window
for that of some other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, he is deceived, but it is in these two
particulars; that, in the first place, he thought me gone; and
secondly, in taking my ladder, for that you are accustomed to
hang out for his accommodation; but he shall repent
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately drawing his sword, and taking his dagger in the
other hand, he would have stabbed his mistress.&nbsp; I also drew
my sword, and put myself before the lady, to guard her from the
blows of this madman: he dealt me several lunges, which I
parried; I drove him to the window, and as he perceived himself
hotly pressed, he sprang out, which gave me immense
chagrin.&nbsp; The lady had left the chamber; I sought her in
vain, and the agitation of this circumstance awoke me.</p>
<p>I leave it to the consideration of the reader, if this vision
is not a faithful image of profane love: this is the beauty that
seduces us; this is the time we improve; this is the passion
which governs us; this is the jealousy which torments us; this is
the hour of temptation: <a name="page83"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 83</span>a rendezvous, a private conversation,
a walk.&nbsp; This is that violent motion which leads to
crime.&nbsp; I leave also to the reader, to make his own
reflections upon the occupations of lovers, upon their desire of
pleasure, upon their intrigues, upon their pains.&nbsp; I am
persuaded that no one can have an idea upon the subject, without
disapproving of the wanderings of love.&nbsp; It is not reason
which rules in the palace I have traversed: for reason is an
enemy whom they attack, whom they disarm, whom they put far from
them, although she is but a kind friend, who never takes up arms
but to succour us.</p>
<h2><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>FIFTH
NIGHT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WORLD.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> a man of genius, or one only of
ordinary discernment, could view the interior of the world, he
would feel indignant at himself even for living with so much
degradation; he could not prevent himself from pitying or
despising those who are attached to it, and who allow themselves
to be deceived by its seductions and artifices.&nbsp; There is
hardly a person who speaks as he thinks; one never sees the
intention of the actor; honesty and knavery have often an air of
resemblance; truth and hypocrisy appear like sisters of the same
father; civility and curiosity assume the same colours;
friendship and interest are with difficulty distinguished.</p>
<p>These reflections occurred to me while walking in my garden; I
entered into a summer house, favourable for meditation, and
inclined to slumber by the coolness of the shade, and the murmur
of a neighbouring rill, fell <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>asleep.&nbsp; During my repose, I
fancied myself in the midst of a great city, called
Hypocrisy.&nbsp; They informed me that it was the capital of the
internal world, and bore the same relation to it, that Rome did
to the external world, in the time of the emperors.&nbsp; It was
here the king of the internal world usually resided; he was
called <i>Self Love</i>; and although he had this appellation,
which is, for the most part, in rather bad odour, he was dear to
his subjects, who made it their chiefest glory to imitate him,
and had no other object than the honour of their sovereign.&nbsp;
The two principal ministers of this king, were Interest and
Ambition: the governor of the city was Pleasure.&nbsp; The guards
of his majesty were designated by the names of other human
passions; the gentlemen of his court were lackeys, well
accoutred; the farmers of the revenue called themselves
<i>ministers of finance</i>: the lawyers, <i>counsellors of the
king</i>: the thieves, <i>judges of police</i>: the grooms of the
stable, <i>equeries of the king</i>: the mountebanks,
<i>physicians</i>: the bankers, <i>masters of accounts</i>: the
clerks of the church, <i>abbots</i>: the clerks of the <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>palace,
<i>secretaries</i>: the students, <i>doctors</i>.&nbsp; There,
tailors wear velvet and gold lace; coblers are cordwainers to the
king; gaming houses, academies: discreditable places, houses of
good society: pimps, convenient people: coquettes, ladies of
honour: women of pleasure, devotees: black girls, handsome
brunettes: in fine, coquetry is friendship: usury, economy:
deceit, wisdom, or prudence: malice, wit: cowardice, equanimity
of temper: temerity, valour: parasites are amiable people:
slanderers, free people: and in like manner of others; for in
this country we perceive every thing to be contrary to that we
see in the external world.</p>
<p>As I promenaded the streets of this city, I met an old man,
who inquired of me if I was a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very apparent, from the surprise you testify at
the novelties of this city; but if you choose, I will show you
things that will astonish you much more: come into my
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having accepted this courteous invitation, <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>he preceded
me without ceremony, observing, that this was the custom in
France.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, signor,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is no more than
justice, that you should be free in your own house; and I know
that it is the French humour, not to accord precedence upon such
occasions: because he who first enters, escapes closing the gate
upon the inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We found in the chamber of this old man, two young friars,
preparing to go abroad.&nbsp; They assured us, they could not
remain any longer, because their superior had ordered them to be
present at a funeral procession, to get their wax taper, and
customary gratuity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What admirable charity in these people,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;who go to a funeral, not to pray, but to gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after, hearing a chanting, we looked from the window to
learn the cause.&nbsp; We saw a funeral procession, in which were
arranged many priests and religious, with a long file of
relations.&nbsp; It was a woman whom they carried to the grave;
the husband was almost mad; and I said to my old friend,
&ldquo;My God! this man is extremely afflicted!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo; answered he:
&ldquo;listen to what he says, when he arrives
opposite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact, when he came near the house, I heard him say,
&ldquo;I am not so very unhappy after all! she has wasted the
half of my fortune: she has been sick in bed at my expense these
last six months; and her obsequies will cost me a thousand
crowns!&nbsp; Ah, Lord!&rdquo; cried he in a loud voice,
&ldquo;why is she dead? and why did you not take me first? or
rather, good Lord, why did you not take her before she had
dissipated my money?&rdquo;&nbsp; At length, reverting to a more
pleasant theme, &ldquo;I must,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;marry
Lucilla: she having been a serving girl, will not be fond of
ostentation; she knows nothing about luxuries, since she cannot
even read.&nbsp; To be sure, being young and inexperienced, she
made a misstep; but the remembrance of her fault will make her
wary.&nbsp; Of the two maids my wife kept, I shall discharge one;
so in three or four years I shall save the expense of this
burial.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I gain by this chance,&rdquo; said a
relation of the deceased, who came next: &ldquo;I gain ten
thousand <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>crowns, because she died intestate.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This pest of a woman,&rdquo; said a maid servant who
followed, &ldquo;never failed to take advantage of every
opportunity, and yet entertained an extreme jealousy of my master
and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zounds!&rdquo; said I to the old man, &ldquo;these
people are very sincere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The things you see here,&rdquo; observed he, &ldquo;are
those which are concealed in the external world; but if now, you
have any curiosity to know with what occupations widows beguile
the time, after the death of their husbands, step with me a
couple of paces and you shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I directly consented; the object appearing well worth the
trouble.&nbsp; There was at the distance of three or four doors
from this chamber a grand apartment, the entrance of which was
hung with black, and the stair-case covered with the same
material.&nbsp; We went in, and after traversing a long hall,
garnished in the same manner, entered into a little room, the
tapestry of which was black velvet; the bed of beautiful red
damask, covered with black crape, with silver fringe.&nbsp; In it
reposed <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>a
young lady of the most conspicuous loveliness, one of the fairest
I have ever beheld.&nbsp; I offered her my condolences upon the
death of her husband, whom my old friend had informed me was a
gentleman of the sword, and a loyal subject of the
king&mdash;<i>Self-love</i>.&nbsp; She answered, smiling in the
most affable manner, that she was highly sensible of my
politeness, and that she felt very happy that the death of her
husband had procured her the pleasure of my acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed I, to myself, &ldquo;what
affliction! but let us examine a little farther.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I approached the bed, and sat down upon a sofa near by: we
conversed upon many things indifferently, and at length came upon
the adventures of young widows.&nbsp; At this period of the
conversation, raising herself up to take her handkerchief, she
exposed to my view, with a beautiful shoulder, a neck fairer than
moonlight.&nbsp; Just as this sight had inspired me with love, I
heard a man snore, who was upon the other side of the bed.&nbsp;
She drew the curtain, and gave the gallant a slight cuff, saying,
&ldquo;you are very impertinent <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>to sleep thus near a lady in
bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other awaking, was going to revenge himself
upon the lady for her slight buffet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do not; I should rather
be punished myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both of them then began to turn their raillery upon me.&nbsp;
Perceiving this, I left the chamber, beckoning the old man to
follow.&nbsp; I was greatly scandalized at such conduct, and my
companion did nothing but laugh.&nbsp; What people you have here!
amiable widows!</p>
<p>Some hours afterwards, I accidentally met in the street, the
beau whom I parted with at the widow&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is thus,&rdquo; said this man, accosting me,
&ldquo;that widows console themselves, and redeem the time they
may have lost with a cross, jealous, or avaricious
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand these matters well,&rdquo; answered I;
&ldquo;and madam will soon forget her loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conferring thus together, we became familiar: he was anxious
to learn my name, and told me his own, which was Joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not astonished,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>beauty
listened to you.&nbsp; A quarter of an hour spent in your
society, will abundantly recompense her for the sad and weary
years passed with a jealous spouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the old man saw us thus pleased with each other, he said
he would leave me in the company of this honest person, and that
he should expect me at his house to supper, after the play, to
which we had determined to go.</p>
<p>At the theatre we saw comedies about equivalent to our
tragedies; and, in fact, of so close a resemblance, that one
might almost fancy them the same.&nbsp; The story of the one I
saw was this:&mdash;Two young persons met at the house of a
mutual friend, to concert measures to gain the consent of their
parents to their marriage: their degree was not equal; the girl
was nobly born, and an heiress; the young man poor, and the son
of a merchant.&nbsp; They both promised to put in requisition
every possible method that could be devised, to vanquish the
opposition of the old folks upon whom they depended.&nbsp; The
young man said he would make himself an advocate, and <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>afterwards a
counsellor in parliament; the expence of which he could easily
defray in one year after his marriage, with the help of his
wife&rsquo;s dowry.&nbsp; The girl, on her part, promised not to
refuse him any token of affection; and agreeable to their plan,
she was to inform her mother, that she was pregnant by <i>Signor
Virodeno</i>; for thus was her lover called.&nbsp; In order to
the furtherance of this design, they instigated their friend to
pretend to betray them, and to apprise the parents of both
parties of what was passing.&nbsp; The parents hastened to the
spot; the lovers came promptly from the chamber; they both heaped
reproaches upon their daughter, and as the mother was about to
strike her, she declared herself pregnant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unhappy
wretch,&rdquo; exclaimed her mother, &ldquo;you will always be a
grief to me; you will bring dishonour upon the family: I will
strangle you on the spot.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said
her husband, &ldquo;you will only expose yourself to be hanged:
we must think rather now to conceal this disgrace.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said the mother; &ldquo;let me stab her to
death with this knife.&rdquo;&nbsp; She would have <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>executed her
resolution, had not her more discreet husband disarmed her,
saying, &ldquo;recollect yourself, madam; you were in the same
situation when I married you; and if your mother had killed you,
you would not to-day have made all this uproar.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
as she continued to give way to fresh paroxysms of indignation,
her husband enforced his reasons with some wholesome
correction.&nbsp; He subsequently conferred with the parents of
the lover, who promised to do every thing for the advancement of
their son, in consideration of the rank of the young lady&rsquo;s
family, with whom they would not be at variance.&nbsp; The
company then gave a loose to mirth; they found out the young
couple were well matched; they busied themselves in preparations
for the nuptials, and sent to apprise the young man, who had
taken refuge at the house of the governor of the city.&nbsp; He
came, accompanied by the proper officers; the marriage was
celebrated; nothing was wanting at the feast, and they parted on
the best of terms.&nbsp; All this scene was in such perfect
keeping, that the young espoused were married <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>at the house
of the maternal father-in-law, who himself did the honours of
friendship.&nbsp; Thus they conclude marriages and other matters:
so that there, one can see the minds of people, and the purpose
of every man&rsquo;s action.</p>
<p>At the palace it is the same; every thing is laid open; the
advocates plead not, but <i>pro honorario</i>; the solicitors
think of nothing but prolonging the suits by those incidents they
themselves devise; and the judges, for the purpose of enhancing
their fees, deliver a hundred judgments, when one would
answer.&nbsp; As a specimen of their method, take the following
decree:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having taken into consideration the petition of Signor
<i>Thief</i>, solicitor to the lord <i>Stupid</i>, the court do
order, that the parties have day in court, for the space of four
years, that the fees may absorb the sum of three hundred pounds,
which must be expended in this suit.&nbsp; Done at our court of
the palace of <i>hypocrisy</i>, at the winter term of the current
year.&nbsp; <i>Pecunia</i>, President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I have related of the palace, is to exemplify <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>the spirit
that reigns in this city; the same influence governs the court,
the army, the treasury, and the theatre.&nbsp; There were in a
box adjoining ours, at the latter place, two men, who discoursed
concerning the sale of certain merchandize.&nbsp; The seller
said, &ldquo;I wish you to give fifty thousand livres, for what
cost me thirty; but I wish to make a thousand crowns
profit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other was not willing to give more than
a hundred pistoles.&nbsp; At last they agreed upon the thousand
crowns, upon condition that the seller, who was a steward, should
give to the purchaser the titles to the rents of certain farms,
without the knowledge of his lord, and upon which event the
purchaser was also to give a feast.&nbsp; After the play, I went
to seek my old friend; upon meeting him, he informed me that the
king, <i>Self-love</i>, was fallen ill; and that on account of
his indisposition, the whole city prepared to testify their
gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;can you think of diversions,
when the father of the country lies sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it becomes us to rejoice;
<a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>it would
be hypocrisy to do otherwise, when we have a prospect of changing
our master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the world of which I am an inhabitant,&rdquo;
rejoined I, &ldquo;we feel the most lively sorrow, if our prince
falls sick; and our religion commands us to offer up prayers for
his health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we,&rdquo; answered the good man, &ldquo;are taught
to rejoice; for we have no other policy than interest, and to
which your religion is opposed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Self-love should die,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you
would perhaps be governed by a less popular king.&nbsp; Pleasure,
who aspires to the crown, Interest, nor either of the other
princes of the blood, would exercise a dominion so happy and
sweet.&nbsp; These princes are naturally proud, cruel, and
vindictive: in the place of which, Self-love is often, nay,
almost always solicitous for the preservation of his
subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation turned upon this topic, for some time.&nbsp;
The old man, contrary to the usual spirit of aged people, was
desirous that Pleasure should succeed to the throne.&nbsp; As for
myself, I maintained that the nation would be less happy, under
such a sway.&nbsp; After our <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>soup, he wanted to carry me to see
the fireworks, and the ball the governor gave upon the
occasion.&nbsp; I refused to go; these things seeming to me very
ridiculous, on account of the cause that elicited them.&nbsp; The
old man was much offended at my refusal; he told me that I was a
sour, dissatisfied man, and an enemy to the general joy.&nbsp; I
replied, that he was an old fool, and that if he molested me any
more, I would throw him out of the window, and put his family to
the sword.</p>
<p>At this moment we heard the cry of fire in the house; and the
common danger caused us to forego our quarrel.&nbsp; The uproar
was caused by a servant girl, who, because her mistress refused,
from some cause or other, to pay her wages, had set fire to the
house, from motives of revenge.&nbsp; They pretended to
extinguish it in a very curious manner, which was, by throwing on
light stuffs, soaked in oil.&nbsp; I dreamt that a great sheet of
flame suddenly enveloped me: I awoke on the instant, crying that
I was in a house environed: and thinking the noise I heard came
from the flame,&mdash;I cried, &ldquo;<i>fire</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; A
servant that was <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>seeking me in the garden, ran, upon hearing me, and told
me that some one waited to see me.&nbsp; When I had finished my
business with this person, my dream caused me much reflection;
the more I thought upon it, the closer seemed the resemblance to
what is taking place in the world: in fact, it is
<i>Self-love</i> that reigns, and these are the passions that
govern us; and whoever could see the heart and soul of men, would
find them arrant hypocrites.&nbsp; The world itself is the city
of Hypocrisy.&nbsp; It is in this city, that interest, ambition,
pleasure, vengeance, anger, and all other evil passions conceal
themselves.&nbsp; The more I examine, the more clearly these
truths appear:&mdash;That whosoever could disabuse himself for a
single moment, would be so, for the remainder of his life: and he
who really desires to know himself and the world, would learn
from observation, more than he has an idea of.&nbsp; The world
is, of all things, the most difficult to understand, and that
which one ought to know the best.&nbsp; There is no person who
distrusts himself; consequently, there is no one who realizes,
that it is deceptive, filled <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>with self-love, attached to its own
interests, seeking its own gratifications, vain, unquiet,
restless, presumptuous, vindictive, pure outwardly, criminal
within, lovely and fair in appearance&mdash;deserving, at bottom,
of hatred and contempt: and what is still more incomprehensible
about this same world, is, there is hardly an individual who doth
not love it; they lose by this love, and they know of a surety,
that it is to this attachment they must attribute their losses:
meanwhile, it pleases all: they seek after it; they wish to serve
it; they abandon to it all which they hold most dear.&nbsp; Some
sacrifice to it their honour for pleasure; others their lives for
glory; and some surrender their repose for the poor ambition of
fortune.&nbsp; But it was for us, the world was created; and that
is really the victim one ought to sacrifice, to preserve his
honour, to enjoy eternal pleasures, to acquire true glory, and
amass treasures, that neither rust nor envy can
spoil.&mdash;Think not, my dear reader, what I have here
presented to you, a dream, a vision; it is more real than you

101</span>SIXTH NIGHT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">HELL.</span></h2>
<p>I had been, during the autumn, at the country house of one of
my friends.&nbsp; In the parish where he resided, that had not
seen its bishop for thirty years, there had recently been settled
a new curate, a fluent preacher, and very much devoted to the
instruction of his flock&mdash;reading every Sunday homilies and
sermons, and the greater and lesser catechisms.&nbsp; One day, I
went to hear one of the familiar exhortations, which he usually
gave to his people, concerning heaven and hell: he depicted the
latter in such strong colours, that the whole audience were
moved; and each whispered to himself, O frightful
residence!&nbsp; Full of these ideas myself, I returned to sup at
my entertainer&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; After quitting the table, I
extended myself on a couch; and my friend, seeing me soon
overcome with a pleasant slumber, for we had fared sumptuously,
left me, to enjoy himself the same refreshment.&nbsp; <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>During
sleep, I dreamed that I was at the outlet of an extensive forest,
from whence diverged two roads, the one smooth and broad, the
other rough, covered with stones and ditches, thorns, and thick
entangled bushes.&nbsp; I pursued the first, in which I remarked
many houses of pleasure, and multitudes of people, who travelled
in carriages, on horseback, or on foot, at a moderate pace,
without fatiguing themselves.&nbsp; One might see there, persons
of all ages, sexes, conditions, and estates; one might find
there, shops, magazines, taverns, play-houses, and societies of
women; in fine, people of every country and religion.&nbsp; I was
not surprised that many came from the narrow way into ours; but I
was greatly so, at some who went from this fine road into the
other, which caused me to inquire where it terminated: as to
ours, I thought it led to Madrid.&nbsp; Some one answered, that
the little way conducted to Paradise; and the one where I was,
direct to Hell.&nbsp; I pursued my journey without making any
other reflection.&nbsp; Having travelled about a quarter of a
league, I began to perceive a bad odour, as of sulphur and
bitumen, <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>and supposed it proceeded from baths of mineral waters,
which diffused a strong scent at a great distance around.&nbsp; I
advanced constantly, and arrived at last before a large edifice,
which answered the description of Pluto&rsquo;s palace, as it is
represented in fable.&nbsp; I found at the gate an immense devil,
horrible to look upon.&nbsp; At this apparition, I stepped
hastily back, two or three paces, and drew my sword, suspecting
that some one was thus disguised, to do me an injury.&nbsp; The
porter, perceiving my embarrassment, approached, telling me to
fear nothing; for he was thus clothed, to deter the saints, who
constantly endeavoured to abstract the damned from hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is then true, that this is hell,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, at your service: enter, enter, my lord, one had
better come here living than dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I immediately walked in, and besought a devil whom I met, to
show me the apartments of the palace: he called himself
<i>Curiosity</i>; this was his appellation of war, or rather that
of his employment; for as angels take theirs from their offices
near God or men, so likewise demons are named, from the services
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>they
execute, or the dignities with which they are invested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They denominate me <i>Curiosity</i>,&rdquo; said the
demon, &ldquo;because it is I who inspire men with the desire of
seeing, listening, proving, and tasting; and as it is curiosity
that opens the door of sin, so it is I who open that of
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may conduct me there,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;on
condition that you bring me back to the gate again, after I have
examined it; and you will oblige me still farther, by leading me
afterwards to paradise, which I would also visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not I,&rdquo; replied Curiosity, &ldquo;who can
conduct you thither, and open the door; the guide of the way is
Retirement, the porter, Virtue; but I will show you every thing
worthy of notice here, and reconduct you to the place from whence
I take you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said I, and followed him.</p>
<p>We first entered into a spacious court, where the devils were
scourging the unhappy, who cried, &ldquo;pardon, pardon, my
God!&nbsp; I did not reflect&mdash;I did not believe&mdash;who
told me of these things;&rdquo; and many other similar
expostulations.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;These,&rdquo; observed the devil, &ldquo;are
people, that have come to hell without thinking about it, without
fear, and without believing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were then honest in their faith; but why punish
those guilty only through ignorance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The devil replied, &ldquo;they ought to think upon the matter,
to instruct themselves, and be persuaded that hell is no place
for mercy&mdash;so much the worse for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I passed from thence into a great chamber, where there were
many men gaming, who swore and blasphemed because they had lost a
little money, or played a bad card.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold these
people,&rdquo; said I to the devil, &ldquo;how impatient and
hasty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the cause of their being here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another room we found comedians, who mourned at their
captivity, shut up for having made the world laugh.&nbsp; Said
they; &ldquo;if by chance some equivocal words have impressed the
spectators with evil thoughts, was it not rather their fault than
ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the devil to me, &ldquo;if they had
done no more than that, they should <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>scarcely have come here; but think
of their lost time, knaveries, and secret crimes!&nbsp; In the
terrestrial paradise, a male and female comedian enacted a scene,
that hath given to the devil the whole human race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! who had they for spectators when they were alone in
the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it is not the comedy which damns the players; it is
what passes behind the scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the following chamber were the physicians and their suit:
they composed poisons for themselves; they took the doses when
prepared; they bled and purged themselves, and tried every
dangerous and disagreeable remedy in medicine, surgery, and
chemistry, to procure death to themselves, and could not
succeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They once used their art,&rdquo; said the devil,
&ldquo;for a bad purpose, and now their art fails them at their
utmost need: do what they will, they cannot die, because the air
of hell is a fire which purifies and conserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a cabinet near this chamber, were a number of persons
endeavouring to make <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>gold, or to speak more plainly,
sought to discover the philosopher&rsquo;s stone: among them I
recognised Tarnesier, he who made the nail half gold and half
iron, which is in the museum of the duke of Tuscany; also a duke
of Saxony, and a duke of the Medici, who knew how to make gold
during their lives, but forgot the secret when they came to
hell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is, then, the making of gold so heinous a sin?&rdquo;
inquired I of the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;but it is a grievous
offence not to know how to make it, and that is the reason these
gentlemen are here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the others,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;who never
pretended to have made the discovery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, they have not passed off copper for gold, as these
have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see the devotees now,&rdquo; said I to my
conductor; &ldquo;they are a species of humanity that will divert
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right; these are the fools of hell; it will be
more instinctive to look at them than those of this
apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we repassed the chambers we had visited, I heard some one
exclaim, &ldquo;Look <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>at this poor devil, who knows not
where to bestow himself; Curiosity is seeking a lodging for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; said one of them to me, &ldquo;remain
here, with the devil&rsquo;s permission, if you cannot be
accommodated elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I passed by without answer, not wishing to hold any
intercourse with the damned.&nbsp; I found in this place monks
and devotees who had hated one another so rancorously, that they
had abused the most holy things of religion, and wasted the time
of the church in giving vent to their malice, and afterwards
would excuse their conduct in terms not used in the world but to
express the most moral, sacred, and holy actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, what hypocrites,&rdquo; said the devil; &ldquo;it
would have been better for them, if they had delivered themselves
openly to those pleasures, they concealed under the appearances
which deceive the vulgar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In another part they were praying after this
fashion:&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, let my father soon taste the joys of
Paradise, that I may take possession of his
estate.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Lord, take speedily <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>my uncle to
thy bosom, that I may have his
benefice.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Great saint, make me fortunate at
play; disdain not my prayer; grant that my children may contract
opulent marriages, and prosper in the
world.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Let my daughter espouse the noble
Spaniard.&rdquo;&mdash;They uttered other supplications fully as
extravagant, and added promises and vows.&mdash;&ldquo;I will
give a hundred crowns to the poor, ornaments to my church, a
dowry to six unhappy orphans, two wax tapers, and a chaplet of
flowers to our lady.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I will wear a dark
coloured habit,&rdquo; said one girl; &ldquo;and I a
white,&rdquo; said another.&nbsp; The first replies, &ldquo;I am
brunette, the violet suits my complexion;&rdquo; the second,
&ldquo;I am red, the white becomes me best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to this apartment was that of women and girls who had
been lovers, and whose number was very considerable.&nbsp; As the
history of their folly was similar, I felt unwilling to listen to
it, but traversed their chamber without stopping, and entered
into the quarter of the poets, to have the satisfaction of
beholding the great geniuses of antiquity.&nbsp; There <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>I was much
surprised to find Homer, sitting in the midst of the Grecian
poets, and reading his own <i>Iliad</i>, he who had been so blind
during his life.&nbsp; I was tempted to ask him some questions
respecting his works, and had an idea he would reply in
verse.&nbsp; With this view I walked round the circle that was
formed, and spoke in these terms to the prince of
poets:&mdash;&ldquo;O, illustrious Homer! light of the universe!
author of the most sublime fictions! the beauty and price of thy
writings surpass the grandeur of the king of Spain, the wisdom of
Charlemagne, the abundance of Ceres, the girdle of the Graces,
the tenderness of Venus, the delicacies of Bacchus, the
brightness of Aurora, the height of heaven, the depth of hell,
the vastidity of the ocean, and the variety of the world, a
Spaniard who wants neither spirit nor courage, of Quevedo,
demands of thee if the victory thou hast attributed to the Greeks
before Troy truly belongs to them; and if Paris, that tender
lover, actually in vain took so much trouble to carry off their
chaste Helen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Homer, rubbing his eyes, answered me <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Here there must needs be sincerity
and truth; for we pay dearly for the boldness and obloquy, that
weak mortals admire: our torments are eternal.&nbsp; I never was
in Ionia: I passed my life in Greece; to honour this nation I
sacked Troy; a city strong, rich, fortunate, and always
victorious, and that was finally destroyed by an
earthquake.&nbsp; Helen, to whom I have accorded the honours of
fidelity, was the least scrupulous of all our frail
damsels.&nbsp; Leave me to relent over what hath charmed all the
poets of the world.&nbsp; Go from this place, and tell mortals
you found me reading, against my inclination, those works that
have attained the universal suffrage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His discourse affected me.&nbsp; I pitied this old man, who
wept upon reading his poems; but I reflected that he had invented
all those fabulous incidents, to which both pagans and Christians
are equally attached.&nbsp; Homer, this genius who knew how to
assume so many changes, had he need to endow with heavenly
powers, those brave men whom he sent to the siege of Troy? he
might have created heroes, without making them gods: to be <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>sure, it is
always permitted to poets to feign and magnify their subjects;
or, in other words, the subjects thus aggrandised and exalted to
heaven have no sublimity but in poesy and upon paper, like the
figures that painters trace on canvass, or sculptors upon
marble.&nbsp; How could the Greeks mistake and worship gods who
had such an origin? however the thing has happened, Homer is the
cause, and now mourns over his poetry and himself; he has for
companions in misery, his disciples and imitators.&nbsp; Ought
this not to serve as a lesson to living poets, who, abusing their
talents, compose and read seductive works, causing those who
think themselves in a condition to do the like, to lose their
time, and often corrupting the heart in recreating the mind.</p>
<p>From this chamber I passed into that of the Latin poets.&nbsp;
Ovid and Virgil there disputed the throne.&nbsp; Horace chafed
that he was not admitted into the contest, and Martial revenged
himself upon them by a piquant epigram.&nbsp; Horace protested
against the whole proceeding of the two first; he demanded
arbitrators, and <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>nominated on his own behalf Scaliger, who has declared
that he would rather have been the author of the ninth ode, than
the possessor of the crown of Arragon; but they would not notice
him.&nbsp; The other poets espoused the party that suited them
best: many declared for Seneca the tragedian, for Terence, and
Plautus.&nbsp; These last, read in a corner of the chamber the
finest passages of their compositions.&nbsp; They now began to
talk of settling the dispute with blows: fearing, therefore, that
I might get an unlucky hit in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, I left the
place, and passed hastily into the chambers of the Spaniards,
Italians, French, English, Turkish, Chinese, and Persian.&nbsp; I
noticed the ancient Gaulish poets, crowned with misletoe of the
oak, making processions, and singing the histories of their first
kings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, upon this side,&rdquo; said Curiosity to me,
&ldquo;is a chamber of perfumers; they have fine scents for the
gratification of the damned; but you would hardly be able to bear
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;a pinch of
snuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>I
drew forth my box, helped myself, and offered it to my devil; he
filled his nose, but from the titilation he felt in his
olfactories, he withdrew his fingers, when he began to sneeze in
such a manner, and with such a noise, that hell itself seemed
sinking under us, he belched forth fire from his nose, as
lightning flashes from a cloud; he put his fore-finger to it, and
there issued forth a rivulet of liquid sulphur, which uniting
with his saliva, formed a torrent of boiling water, that flowed
across the chamber, and passed through the doors and windows;
without that I believe I should have been drowned.&nbsp; These
waters fell upon people underneath, who began to call for help,
thinking a river of melted sulphur and pitch fell upon
them.&nbsp; The devil laughed heartily at this disorder, and told
me my snuff was excellent: he asked for another pinch; I did not
dare to refuse him, because he was in his own house; and such a
refusal might, perhaps, have made him regard me as
impolite.&nbsp; But this time, when I put my fingers into the
box, the powder took fire as if it had been saltpetre, and burnt
in my <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>hands, at which accident I was not sorry, being
apprehensive of another disorder, similar to the first.</p>
<p>We then entered the chamber of the perfumers: they were
occupied in extracting essences of intolerable odours, which are
as agreeable to them as jessamine, tuberose, orange, and others
in use among the men and women of our world: they made these
essences from the oil of the box tree, from wax, jet, and yellow
amber.&nbsp; Their pomatums were composed of galbanum,
assaf&oelig;tida, rosin, pitch, and turpentine.&nbsp; I was
informed that these were for the use of the ladies of hell, who
were served by the perfumers, and who were, at the same time,
obliged to use their compounds, in obedience to the laws of
Lucifer.</p>
<p>From thence, we proceeded along a broad aisle, which
terminated at an elevated pavilion, the apartment of the
astrologers and magicians.&nbsp; I met at the door a chiromancer,
who desired to inspect my hand.&nbsp; I extended it without
ceremony; but scarcely had I touched his, before I was glad to
withdraw it, it seemed so hot and fiery.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;I have remarked at a glance,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that you will be happy if you are prudent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what have you noticed
with regard to your own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;by the mount of
Saturn, that I was to be damned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well! if you had exercised the prudence you
recommend to me, you would not have been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I passed without further speech, and saw a man, who, with
compasses, measured upon a globe, the distances between the
celestial signs: &ldquo;what are you doing, good man?&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, God!&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;if I had been born
but half an hour sooner, when Saturn changed his aspect, and Mars
lodged in the house of life, my salvation had been
certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others made similar observations, so that one could hardly
forbear laughing at their complaints.&nbsp; There came up one
named Taisnerius, author of a book upon physiognomy and
chiromancy, who gazed in my face for such a length of time, that
he quite embarrassed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look like an old burnt shoe,&rdquo; said I <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to him;
&ldquo;go your ways; do not stop so near me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at this beggar,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;see how he
affects the man of consequence, because he wears a sword by his
side, and hath the cross of Saint James!&nbsp; What a
physiognomy!&nbsp; What an aspect!&nbsp; What a figure!&nbsp;
This man goes straight to the gibbet: besides, there is here
neither wealth nor rank; all are equal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insolent fellow,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;if I draw my
sword, I will teach you how to speak to a man of honour; have you
not had experience enough to be wise? you ought to bear in mind
the correction you received in Portugal, for treating a gentleman
in the same indecorous manner you have me; but you are
incorrigible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taisnerius,&rdquo; said my devil, &ldquo;get into your
hole, and draw your own horoscope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this trifling dispute, we advanced, and encountered many
astrologers, among whom were Hali, Gerard of Cremona, Barthelemi
of Parma, a certain personage by the name of Tondin, and
Cornelius Agrippa.&nbsp; The moment this last perceived me, he
cried out that <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;the world did him injustice, in calling him
Agrippa the black&mdash;in accusing him of magic, and other
similar things, for which, he averred, he had not been damned:
that he was born in an age of ignorance, when good physicians
passed for magicians, astrologers for sorcerers, and all learned
men for people who had converse with the devil; that his book
upon the Cabala, was nothing more but a satire upon the
cabalistic art of the Jews, and the little key of Solomon; and
finally, the book itself might be taken as a criterion of his
faith, in those things by which they deceived the simple, and of
the vanity of that science.&nbsp; I am no more a magician,&rdquo;
continued he, &ldquo;than Cardan, whom you can see if you
wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why then have you been damned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I abused my knowledge, and amused myself with
people&rsquo;s credulity; if I had indeed been a magician, I
should have become penitent, and been saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While I was speaking, I heard a tremendous uproar, proceeding
from another apartment, and inquiring the cause, was informed the
Turks were fighting; and as I happened <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>to
understand their language, discovered the quarrel was, in fact,
between Mahomet and the two prophets, who had each established a
sect in the Mahometan law.&nbsp; Mahomet complained very bitterly
against Ali, because he had given to the Persians a false
Alcoran, and because Albubekir had so illy explained his own, in
Africa.&nbsp; He, on the contrary, maintained that the Alcoran
could have no other meaning, than what he had attached to
it.&nbsp; Ali asserted, there was no reason in this law; and
furthermore, he contended, that Mahomet himself knew nothing
about the book he had composed.&nbsp; They chafed furiously upon
this, and cried out, as if enraged to madness; I heard their
dialogue, but do not wish to be the herald of their
quarrels.&nbsp; This was gentleness itself, compared with what
passed among the heretic and schismatic Christians; there I saw
Luther in the habit of the Augustine order, with his monks about
him, and a pot of wine on the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do the dead
drink,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;to the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all; but this wine is set before their eyes, for
the purpose of tormenting them <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>with the sight of what they loved so
well; it is for the same reason, that Luther has his wife with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Melancthon was also there; he wept continually, and was so
unquiet, that he could not remain an instant at rest: he
traversed from right to left upon all sides, and then returned to
the place from whence he set out, only to recommence the same
journey.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is this man doing?&rdquo; said I to
Curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He imitates the conduct he pursued in the world; for
there he was alternately with Luther and the church; sometimes a
Zuinglian, and sometimes a Calvinist; thus are the inconstant
tormented.&nbsp; This good old man whom you see here, is Erasmus;
this other is Grotius; unhappily, they neither of them had any
religion.&nbsp; This man, who appears so sour, and is surrounded
with ministers, is Calvin, who brought about the
reformation.&nbsp; These others, are heretics of the first ages,
who are here for being reluctant to submit to legitimate
authority.&nbsp; See the great Photius patriarch of
Constantinople, how the Greeks surround him: he is justly
punished for <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>having quitted the ministry for the patriarchate; if he
had remained in a civil station he would have been saved; but
being mixed up in ecclesiastical affairs, he committed so much
wickedness, that he now suffers no more than he
deserves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man so learned!&rdquo; said I to the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, too much so; and too much knowledge is often more
injurious than profitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I began now to tire of hell, and fatigued with my walk,
intimated a desire to my conductor to depart, and to be
accompanied by him as far as the gate.&nbsp; He replied, he
wished first to show me the apartment of the contractors, whom I
had not yet seen, and which was upon a line with that in which we
were.&nbsp; I then entered into the chambers of these farmers of
the revenue, and was surprised to see such a multitude, each
habited in the garb of his own country.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are
here, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;people from all quarters of the
globe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the devil, &ldquo;since there are
every where imposts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why,&rdquo; demanded I, &ldquo;are these people <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>damned, who
have levied the lawful tribute of legitimate princes?&nbsp; I
have read in the scripture that it is lawful to pay tribute unto
C&aelig;sar: how shall this tribute be paid, unless there are
people to collect it? must one be damned for doing a
duty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold, hold,&rdquo; cried the demon; &ldquo;not quite so
much philosophy; these contractors were full as philosophical as
you are; but it is nevertheless true, if they had only levied the
tribute due to their prince, they would not have been damned; but
they raised one not due, either to the prince or to themselves:
they would have been much better off, had they not made so much
expense, and the prince had given them but a shilling for a
pound.&nbsp; Calculate, for a moment, what an enormous sum is
requisite, for the compensation of the host of subalterns
attached to an office; consider then, how much the principal must
gain; add to that, what goes into the coffers of the king,
without mentioning what is styled the <i>perquisites</i>, and you
will find that not more than one per cent of the ducats are
realized at the treasury; and that, he <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>who gets
the most, is doubtless the farmer.&nbsp; If the king of Spain
would oblige them to send straight to him the custom on exports
and imports, he would profit by that the contractors get.&nbsp;
There needs but one commissary, for all the revenues of the king,
in each office; he should supervise all the books and accounts,
contenting himself with a generous salary for his care, punishing
frauds by pecuniary fines, and by corporeal inflictions for
second offences.&nbsp; If the matter was thus managed, the king
would be richer, and taxes less; the people would be less
burthened, and almost all this great number of contractors, would
remain in commerce, in the army, or country.&nbsp; How much
should you say,&rdquo; demanded the devil, &ldquo;the king
received, of what is annually taken from the royal
mines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About three quarters,&rdquo; replied I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be too well off,&rdquo; exclaimed he, with a
cry of admiration; &ldquo;he does not get the thousandth part;
all goes in outfits, in expenses; and I verily believe, that if
these things are to continue thus, the king would <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>gain more
by closing them, than in causing them to be worked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;there is a necessity
of levying imposts, of having contractors, and paying them well:
the neighbouring princes do the same, to furnish their charges
and expenses of war: if this is an evil, it is one that must be
endured, to preserve the whole body politic from
destruction.&nbsp; But how is it possible, you can so vehemently
dislike the gentlemen of the revenue, who form by far the largest
part of your infernal population?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the force of reason,&rdquo; answered he,
&ldquo;that compels even demons to avow the truth, and both to
love and detest the wickedness we are desirous of detecting in
others, to make them companions of our misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I admire,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the force of truth; and
I admire not less to see injustice hated, even among the unjust;
but I cannot comprehend, why you should say, that however
legitimate the tribute due to the prince, the contractors cannot
conscientiously take the public money.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;You misapprehend me; that they can do; but the
farmers collect more money than is consistent with equity, or the
orders of the prince; they extort that which should be useful for
the maintenance of the public weal: it is of this charge, of this
waste, the contractors are guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you,&rdquo; said I to the demon;
&ldquo;but conduct me from hence, for I am weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued:&mdash;&ldquo;Do you comprehend what I say, that
it is the contractors who are most happy and rich? and from
whence come those superb mansions, as magnificently furnished as
the Escurial palace? how can they support such enormous expenses?
entertain so many gentlemen? give their daughters such ample
dowries? contract advantageous alliances with the noblest
families of Castile and Arragon?&nbsp; Such an one shall command
to-day, and be covered in the king&rsquo;s presence, who a year
since drove a chariot, or stood behind a carriage.&nbsp; Another,
who hired his land, shall presently purchase the farm he formerly
cultivated.&nbsp; Appointed a subaltern <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>in one of
the offices, he soon becomes its head, and is elevated by degrees
to the nobility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon having finished, I thanked him, and wishing to
impress the lesson on my memory, engaged him to repeat it.&nbsp;
He summed up the whole in the following
manner:&mdash;&ldquo;Observe neither what reason or the law
prescribes to thee, respect neither God nor the king, lay the
peasantry under contribution, succumb to the great, become a
great proprietary farmer, cause the purchaser to pay you twice
for what you sell: to put out of sight the baseness of your
origin, obtain an appointment in one of the bureaux, and accustom
yourself to command; for by these gradations one may arrive at
the highest dignities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What signifies all that,&rdquo; said one of the
contractors, who listened to our discourse; &ldquo;is it not
natural for a person to elevate himself if he can?&nbsp; Is it
not the order of Providence, that the lofty should be abased, and
the humble exalted?&nbsp; Fortune is but a wheel, which in its
revolutions puts underneath <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>what but now was on top.&nbsp; If
the subjects were more attached to the government, the sovereign
would have less need of imposts, and consequently of
collectors.&nbsp; If they were perfectly just, they would not
need a king.&nbsp; To complain of our avarice is to accuse
heaven; instead of which only the impenetrability of individuals
should be reproached, who would rather see a great kingdom like
Spain entirely overthrown, than advance a single real to repair
the slightest breach.&nbsp; Know, Signor Devil, who has delivered
such a philippic against the contractors, that we have been to
our country, what the bones and muscles are to the human body, or
numerous armies to a province threatened with an invasion: if the
king of hell would but consult with us, we should teach him to
fortify his dominions in such a manner, that they would be
impregnable to both saints and angels.&nbsp; In the first place,
I would lay a tax upon every demon who plies his occupation in
the world: secondly, I would establish a daily employment for
each soul in the infernal world: thirdly, I would make the
magicians and sorcerers <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>pay an annual tribute: this will be
done, for I have heard the king of the demons was about to
organise a council of financiers; and this is a subject that
might well engage even the attention of that celebrated
Englishman, who invented the first paper currency of
England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And wherefore,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;impose a
tax on us?&nbsp; What will you do when we refuse to pay?&nbsp;
Can you confiscate our estates?&nbsp; In what prisons will you
confine us when you have decreed our arrest?&nbsp; We should mock
at all your projects: ah, little man! you grow licentious! you
must be chained up; come, obey; extend your hands and
legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do neither the one nor the other,&rdquo; said
the contractor; &ldquo;you are not here our master; I will call
the financial council together; and I am going this instant to
denounce you to the grand inquisition, because you resist paying
tribute to the king of Spain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I laugh at your inquisition,&rdquo; said the demon,
&ldquo;and to be beforehand with you, I will <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>denounce
you to the prince of devils himself: come, quick, obey; extend
your hands and legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contractor found himself loaded with irons, in spite of
his remonstrances: the devil then went into the apartment of the
inquisitors to subject them to the same treatment, and afterwards
returned to accompany me to the gate, as I had requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These insolents,&rdquo; muttered he, &ldquo;these
insects! what pride! what rodomontades! was there ever seen such
supercilious knaves?&nbsp; But I will humble them in such a
manner, and make them suffer so much, that they will have no
stomach to talk of imposts and taxes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we had left these contractors, (whom I regard as the most
unhappy class in hell, because, let them do ever so much good to
the prince or to the state, let them be ever so upright in their
administration, nay, even if they were angels, they could not
escape accusation and hatred) our attention was attracted by an
immense crowd, which had arrived and filled up the avenue in such
a manner, <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>that we could not pass, and so were obliged to fall
back to the opposite gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who are these
people?&rdquo; inquired I of the demon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;a corps of tailors;
they arrive here in crowds, like great armies, and when they
come, all the demons are put in requisition to confine them; my
duty compels me to assist; go with me, and amuse yourself with
our proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We made our way through this crowd of tailors, and arrived at
length, before a great furnace, the mouth of which was more than
ten fathoms in diameter.&nbsp; There they bound these tailors in
faggots, putting from ten to a dozen in each bundle: they
fastened each one by the feet, and then brought a rope about the
whole package, and afterwards suspending the faggot to a hook,
which was elevated by means of a pulley, over the centre of the
furnace, a devil detached it, and let it fall into the
fire.&nbsp; Sometimes the tailors who had their arms free,
grasped so firmly the pulley, that the devil had an infinite deal
of trouble to loose their hold: when that took place, he caused
the whole mass to make a pirouette in <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>the air, and as the motion was
violent, the tailors were always forced to let go, and drop into
the fire.&nbsp; It happened that one of these faggots fell
outside the aperture, upon a quantity of others, which were
ranged like a pile of wood, and which the devil measured.&nbsp;
The individuals of this faggot, seized hold of the others in such
a manner, that they could not separate them; so that the devils
who united their strength for that purpose, were obliged to take
the whole pile, attach it to the hook, and let it all go
together.&nbsp; The mass was so great, that it seemed as if it
would choke the fire of hell.&nbsp; The devils bestirred
themselves, and finally made an end of the tailors; they then
cast in a great quantity of oil, tallow, and sulphur, and
stirring them up with long iron tormentors, and employing large
bellows, the fire caught all at once, and raised a flame, that
rose above the mouth of the furnace more than three hundred
feet.&nbsp; All the tailors having been cast into the fire, their
demon general, with a haughty and severe air, came to demand of
me, why I had not been bound with the others.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I to him, &ldquo;I am not a
tailor, a rogue, a thief, neither a cabbager of stuff nor money;
I am here with my companion, Curiosity, to inspect the beauties
and antiquities of this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a liar,&rdquo; replied the general; &ldquo;you
are one of my subjects; I know you by your strait-cut dress,
which, without doubt, you have made out of the clippings of some
other; come, obey; cast yourself into the fire, or I will throw
you in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was about to bind me, my demon informed the general that
I was not yet dead; that I had never been of any trade, and that
he believed I should not be one of their subjects, because those
who descended quick into hell, conducted themselves afterwards in
such a manner, as not to revisit it after death; furthermore, the
cross of Saint James, (which I carried,) would inspire fear, and
cause false alarms in the bosoms of the damned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come hither, then,&rdquo; said the general, &ldquo;and
profit by what you see; you know, at least, that tailors are the
fuel of hell, and serve to burn those that come
hither.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>My
demon advised me to go promptly, because if the general should
get angry, he might do me a mischief.&nbsp; In walking along, he
informed me the unhappy tailors were so numerous, that they not
only fed the great furnace of hell, which warmed all the
apartments, but also furnished the table of Lucifer, when he had
a mind to feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; exclaimed I, &ldquo;Lucifer eat?&nbsp; Can
spirits eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;that the
damned are as the herb the sheep eateth, and that death is this
sheep?&nbsp; Have you not read in your sacred books, that death
devoureth the damned?&nbsp; <i>Mors depascet eos</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he was speaking, we met a troop of booksellers, at whose
head was one Peter Marteau, a publisher, of Cologne; he was
loaded with a burden so unwieldy, that it was impossible to
comprehend how any one man could bear it.&nbsp; They informed me,
these were the books printed under his name, after his
death.&nbsp; The booksellers of Holland were also very heavily
laden; and those of France bore also the books struck off at
their houses, with <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>the title of a Dutch bookseller.&nbsp; These people
were carrying their books to the furnace, but were prevented by a
singular accident: a demon, who passed by with a flambeau,
approaching to look at them, their papers caught fire, and
instantly spread from one to another through the whole body: when
they perceived the flame, they threw down their loads, and fled
with all convenient speed.&nbsp; I asked them why they were
damned: they answered, for the faults of others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An author,&rdquo; observed they, &ldquo;often carries a
work to the printer, which has no merit, and besides, as
unsaleable as a girl, ugly and poor: by this means the printer is
ruined; in vain he curses the author, and seeks to reimburse
himself by the sale of an unpopular book; this book is the cause
of his failure; his creditors seize his goods and shop; he
maddens, and resigns himself to despair.&nbsp; A translator, who
understands Greek, undertakes a dull work; sometimes he supposes
he has discovered a manuscript; he carries his translation to the
printer, who, not being able to get rid of it, sells the leaves
to the grocer or <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>butter woman.&nbsp; Another cause of our damnation; a
bookseller sells at a handsome profit, the <i>satires</i> of
Juvenal, the <i>comedies</i> of Terence, and of other poets, as
those of Virgil and Ovid; a lackey, a shop-boy, a soldier, a
clerk, purchase these works, and amuse themselves among serving
girls, with what cost long study to these men of genius.&nbsp;
Without mentioning other books we vend, and which obtain
circulation, only because they flatter the taste or passions of
the buyer, is it not true, that a pretty story of gallantry,
secret memoirs, cabinet intrigues, which profess to expose the
designs of the government, or the end of some great affair, are
the most dangerous books? and these are the kind we sell
best.&nbsp; Is it us, then, upon whom reproach ought to fall, or
on the readers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He speaks advisedly,&rdquo; said a Holland publisher;
&ldquo;we have put to press all the follies of certain authors,
who wished to revenge themselves, either upon a mistress, judge,
minister of state, or prince; and for this we must needs be
adjudged guilty of other&rsquo;s faults, and share their
punishment! but that would <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>have been slight, if we had not
meddled with books of religion.&nbsp; We have published in
Holland the works of all parties; Christians, Jews, Catholics,
Protestants, Socinians, Quakers, and every other sect; and often
in the same book, sold both sides of the controversy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;no
religion!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; replied the Dutchman, &ldquo;the
historians of authors; and as a historian must have neither
relations, country, friends, nor religion, even so we have none
of these; but under the name of citizens of the world, have but
one object, and that, the advancement of our own
interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately upon these words, he hastily fled with the others,
to re-assemble themselves near the demon of the book merchants,
who called for his whole crew.&nbsp; I felt great compassion at
the fate of these unhappy wretches, condemned to hell, because
they were brought up to the profession of publishing the dreams
and extravagances of authors: it is worthy also of reflection,
that they are compelled to consult the taste of the age, and of
the multitude.&nbsp; <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>Now the taste of the age is
exceedingly fickle: it is not that of learned men and wits; books
of morality and criticism are purchased much less readily than
novels and profane histories; so that book merchants, in their
condition, have an unhappiness that attaches itself to no other
trade, independently of the fact, that this business is not held
in the same estimation at the present day, that it formerly
was.&nbsp; They were then ranked with men of letters; they were
admitted to the bar and church; the cardinal Ximenes bestowed on
them great preferments; he ennobled him who published the famous
<i>Bible d&rsquo;arrias montars</i>.&nbsp; We see, in his time,
publishers who possessed rich abbeys and seats in the
council.&nbsp; And what was not done for them by the fifth
Sixtus, that incomparable genius?&nbsp; In France, they arrived
at great distinction, and have been seen in the first posts of
the principal cities of the kingdom; and we know that a
celebrated emperor of Germany, was one of the first publishers,
if not himself the inventor of printing.&nbsp; But to return from
this digression: when the book merchants were <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>re-assembled, the notaries, who had just arrived,
wished to place themselves in their ranks; but the devil used his
authority to separate them, averring that there was, in fact, a
vast difference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without doubt,&rdquo; said the notaries, &ldquo;we are
the book merchants of manuscripts; we compose and publish our
works, to which the public accord the same faith, as to things
they have themselves seen; we are faithful public witnesses, the
guarantees of contracts, promises, and obligations; the guardians
of titles, rights, and privileges; our testimony is true,
infallible; above suspicion, deceit, and fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;are you come to
hell? for if you fulfilled those duties, you are honest people,
and I declare, not only useful, but necessary to the public; for,
between ourselves, there is so little public sincerity, that if
one could not prove, by writings and witnesses, the price at
which he bought or sold, he would often find himself cheated of
his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said one of the notaries, &ldquo;for some
antedates or superfluous ciphers, that we are <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>damned;
judge you, if the matter is of such vital consequence; one is so
often deceived by writings, and one figure is so easily
substituted for another;&mdash;the pen too, slips sometimes, and
a nought is so easily made!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, in truth,&rdquo; said the devil,
addressing himself to me; &ldquo;they wrong these poor people, in
sending them to us; they have committed trifling faults, while
they do not punish the apothecaries, even, for putting up the
recipes sent them.&nbsp; I have a great mind to send these
unfortunate persons home again.&mdash;Go; return, my friends; you
have suffered great injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we also,&rdquo; said the corps of bankrupts; for
they had done them the honour to separate them from the
merchants, who had dealt honestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to you, Signors,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;enter
into the furnace, without further examination: we leave it to the
notaries to enter at pleasure; they have within them a torment as
cruel as fire; it is conscience, that never yet respected any
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh! ah, ah!&rdquo; cried the bankrupts, <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>&ldquo;if
they had not wronged us, we should have kept our faith with every
one: would you, because we were cheated, that we should send our
families to the almshouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not go to Holland, or to the islands, when I
failed,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;I shut myself up in a private
room in my house, and there negotiated, through my wife, with my
creditors, making each one to remit a part of his just claims:
you know what would have happened, had I appeared; there is
seldom much charity among creditors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;did much better; for I
transported from Madrid to Venice all the merchandises I had
collected, changed my name, and after having made a fortune upon
these goods, paid the principal, on condition they would remit
the interest: was there not in this bankruptcy, good faith,
justice, and prudence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the devil, &ldquo;and I cannot
conceive on what grounds you were condemned; it is very evident
it must have been for something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; continued the man, &ldquo;it was for this <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>very thing;
because they pretend that for these twenty years, I have injured
my creditors, in depriving them of the enjoyment and possession
of their property; consider, Signor devil, if I am under an
obligation to repair this damage? would it not only be
ridiculous, but render them guilty of usury towards
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! the honest man,&rdquo; said the devil; &ldquo;why
do they send to us folks so upright and sincere? but my
friend,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;you have the ill luck to be
found in bad company; we cannot help you; arm yourself,
therefore, with courage, and prepare to support the sufferings to
which the bankrupts are destined; you will be forced to accustom
yourself to much pain; but console yourself, by uniting your
complaints with those of your comrades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Directly the devil stamped upon the pavement, where the
publishers, notaries, and bankrupts stood, when a trap door,
springing open, engulphed them all, and closed itself as
before.</p>
<p>At this stage of my dream, I was awakened by a serenade of
violins and hautboys, that <a name="page142"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 142</span>some one gave to a young lady of the
house.&nbsp; I immediately arose, and looking from the window,
saw a number of young men, who, after a prelude upon their
instruments, began to sing.&nbsp; As there was no window but mine
open, they imagined they beheld the beauty to whom their homage
was addressed; and to amuse myself at their expense, I threw out
a splendid handkerchief, which one of them eagerly caught; he
kissed it more than an hundred times; then putting a diamond,
worth thirty pistoles, into a purse, threw it into my chamber,
with a billet couched in these terms:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My charming princess, at night my heart awakes for
thee; by day, I am only occupied with your charms.&nbsp; I burn,
without cessation, with the love you have inspired; when shall I
have the happiness to express to you in private, what I feel, and
what your silence causes me to suffer? one sweet line from your
hand, shall re-assure and console me.&nbsp; Speak, and nothing
can equal my happiness; continue silent, my misery is at its
height, and I have no relief, but in death.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>After
perusing this billet, I answered it in the following manner, the
substance of which was furnished by a song I happened to
remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When one reigns, or when one loves, the pain is not
without its pleasures; solicitude renders them more vivid.&nbsp;
Happy prince!&nbsp; Happy lover! it is not in vain you suffer;
they will resist you but slightly, when they themselves suffer
from protracted resistance; yes, when one reigns, or when one
loves, the pain is not without its pleasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cast my billet from the window, and it was soon taken
up.&nbsp; The adventure seemed to me very pleasant: behold what
followed; I deposited in the bed of the fair, the diamond that
was designed for her, not being able to keep it longer with
honour, and without exposing myself to the anger of the young
lady, who would soon know by what window it entered.&nbsp; Upon
retiring the next night, she found it; she informed her lover of
the discovery, and he explained the whole affair.&nbsp; She
thanked me graciously for my gallantry; <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>I gave her
the billet I had received, and she returned my
handkerchief.&nbsp; The mistake arose from my having lain, that
night, in the chamber ordinarily occupied by this young lady, her
bed having been removed to that of her father, and on that
account was unable, as usual, to answer her gallant.&nbsp; She
made me the confidant of her attachment, and besought my good
offices with her father, which I so zealously used, that in less
than a month, I assisted at the marriage of these lovers.</p>
<p>Those who interpret dreams, say, that the one I had concerning
hell, hardly presaged this adventure.&nbsp; I pray those who read
my reveries, or nocturnal visions, to consider that they contain
more truth, than one would be apt, at first, to imagine: by day
they ought to occupy themselves with thoughts upon hell, as
intently as they would in the most important affair; or as they
would seek the means of deliverance, if shut up in prison, for a
crime against the state.&nbsp; One is damned for a less offence
than the robbery of the treasury, revolt, or parricide.&nbsp;
Yes, for a much <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>slighter fault, one shall be eternally tormented in
hell.&mdash;Reflect often upon this, dear readers, lest you have
it to say, through the interminable ages of futurity, &ldquo;<i>I
could not have thought it</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>SEVENTH NIGHT.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE REFORMATION OF HELL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I promenaded one day in my
garden, thinking of demons, which are always at the back of every
one, the foolish idea struck me, that it would not be wholly
useless to reform my life.&nbsp; I felt a curiosity to see my
evil demon; but, thought I to myself, if I should see him I
believe I should die with fear.&nbsp; No, said I again, I should
not be terrified, if he would but show himself in a human
shape.&nbsp; After having repressed this improper curiosity, and
resumed my composure, I heard a man speaking to me; and turning
my eyes to that side from whence the voice proceeded, I
perceived, through a grated door, which separated the garden from
the park, on the other side, a gentleman of a good mien, who
requested me to open the gate, as he wished to have some
conversation with me.&nbsp; As he resembled a man with whom I had
formerly some misunderstanding, I refused; but he <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>passed over
it before I had the power to prevent him.&nbsp; Immediately
drawing my sword, I set upon him; and he doing the same, parried
my thrusts and stood upon the defensive only.&nbsp; As I
perceived that his figure at one moment contracted, and anon
dilated to a huge magnitude, I began to suspect that he was
either a magician or a demon; and stepping rearward some paces,
demanded who he was.&nbsp; He answered that he was my demon, and
wished to render me a service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no need of such service,&rdquo; said I to him;
&ldquo;for demons are both deceptive and malicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;fear nothing; only
come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Forthwith he transported me into the air, and I soon lost
sight of my house and garden.&nbsp; In a short time we drew near
the moon; and while passing, I gazed attentively upon those
valleys, mountains, and lakes, which are but imperfectly
perceived from the earth by the aid of telescopes.&nbsp; The
demon transported me to Sicily and set me down upon the summit of
a mountain covered with cinders yet hot, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>which he
told me was Etna.&nbsp; There was, from this place, a very fine
prospect; one sees all the beauties of the isle, and of the
surrounding seas: in the distance, the highlands of Africa are
distinguished, like fleecy clouds, upon the verge of the horizon;
a multitude of vessels were sailing in view, which seemed like
white ants, or flies, sporting upon the surface of the
ocean.&nbsp; After we had rested there about one hour, the demon
told me to follow him.&nbsp; We descended into an aperture from
whence belched forth smoke and flame that illumined the whole
mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;that Pliny
fell, when he had the temerity to approach too near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole way, as we proceeded, was composed of rocks and fat
earth, like bitumen, and from time to time, might be seen veins
of sulphur.&nbsp; The rocks were full of little crevices, from
whence issued vapours and sulphurous exhalations, and sometimes
slight gusts of wind.&nbsp; When we had travelled downwards about
the space of an hour, we came to a vast cavern, into which we
entered; at its extremity <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>was an immense palace, hewn in the
rock, and elevated upon massive pillars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said the demon, &ldquo;is the palace of
Lucifer.&nbsp; Let us enter into the great hall, where we shall
see him give a general audience to the damned: listen attentively
to what shall be said; examine the events that take place, and
let what you shall see serve for your instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is a correct account of what I saw in these
subterraneous abodes.&mdash;For a long time, Lucifer, the ruler
of hell had not given audience to his subjects: the disorder that
ordinarily obtain in states from the negligence of princes, are
incidental as well among demons as men.&nbsp; The evil spirits
remained sometimes for ages in the world, without rendering any
account of the souls they had gained, and often suffered
themselves to be driven from the tenements of which they were
masters; the address of some monk or priest snatching from them
their conquest.&nbsp; Men performed in hell the office of demons;
and as they frequently left their chains to seek their enemies,
battles were as common, as <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>formerly between the Romans and
Gauls.&nbsp; Lucifer, either from a fear for his crown, or
weariness at seeing so many combats, resolved one day to hear, in
general convention, the complaints of the damned; to introduce a
reform among the demons; to re-establish the submission and
obedience due to his sceptre, and to extend the boundaries of his
empire by new conquests: this was very easy of execution,
provided he would give access and free parlance to his subjects,
and compel his demons to render an exact account of their
administrations.&nbsp; With this design he secretly consulted
with Belzebub, the prince of devils, Belial, the governor-general
of Pagan nations, and Ashtaroth, the princess who commands all
women.&nbsp; At the termination of this council, circular letters
were published, which ordained that all those who had complaints
to prefer, and all the demons scattered over the world, should
assemble upon an appointed day in the great hall of the palace,
when and where they should be heard.</p>
<p>The day fixed being arrived, the hall was presently filled,
and measures taken, that as <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>soon as one party was heard, another
should enter.&nbsp; Lucifer was seated upon his golden throne,
having upon each side those princes I have before
mentioned.&nbsp; After having inveighed against the disorders
prevalent in hell, and stated his determination to rectify them,
he signified his permission to the standers by to speak.&nbsp; At
this intimation there arose an old man of a haughty appearance,
and having a crown of laurel upon his head; he read the Roman
laws touching parricides, and amplified upon the ingratitude of
natural and adopted children towards their parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The parties,&rdquo; said Belzebub to Lucifer,
&ldquo;must be ordered, before commencing their speeches, to
announce their names, because many of them have been dead a great
length of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such a decree was accordingly made; and he who had now spoken
about half an hour, said that he was Julius C&aelig;sar, the
first emperor of the Romans.&nbsp; &ldquo;Under the pretext of
the liberty of our common country,&rdquo; continued he,
&ldquo;Brutus and Cassius, to gratify their ambition,
assassinated me in the midst of the <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>senate, their enmity was not
directed against the empire and monarchy, which were, on the
contrary, the object of their desires; but they hated the
emperor, who had magnified the Roman power, and extended its
dominion both north and east.&nbsp; Was the government better
administered in the hands of those senators, who, by their feuds
and personal dislikes, perilled the salvation of the republic, by
resigning it into the hands of a perpetual dictation, whom they
were obliged shortly afterwards to elect?&nbsp; Rome having once
tasted the benefits of monarchy, preferred rather to obey a Nero,
a Tiberius, a Caligula, or a Heliogabulus, than to re-establish
this pretended public liberty, for which Brutus and Cassius,
those two traitors, took up arms against the father of their
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He continued his discourse in this strain, and concluded by
moving, that they should be treated in hell as assassins, public
disturbers, and traitors.</p>
<p>Brutus then arose, and with a trembling voice, said:
&ldquo;Senators, you have heard C&aelig;sar; have you not been
biassed by his <a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>eloquence?&nbsp; But will you forget the services I
have rendered?&nbsp; Remember the advice you privately gave me,
to encourage the glorious design I had conceived in favour of
your liberty?&nbsp; Answer then to C&aelig;sar, that it was by
your advice I gave the fatal stab; that if the laws had not been
abrogated and violated by the formidable power of tyranny, you
would, yourselves, have put him to death under the forms of
justice; and that your silence, after the execution of my
project, was an evidence of your approbation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cassius, assuming the discourse, said he would not undertake
to plead his own cause if Cicero was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not,&rdquo; said C&aelig;sar, &ldquo;listen to
this timid sycophant; this cowardly soul; this selfish orator:
when he feared my power, he said, in full senate, that he would
be my buckler against enemies, and, at the same time, conspired
against my life, and defends the act of Brutus and Cassius.&nbsp;
His cupidity was so eager, that for money, he might be bought on
the same day to speak upon both sides of a case; and so
sober-tongued, that there was <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>not a soldier in the army, who would
have bestowed upon his greatest foe one tittle of the scurrility
he heaped upon Anthony.&nbsp; You recollect, Signors, his
phillipics: he had not the courage to support a change of
fortune; and the common cause was abandoned by this patriotic man
before he was slain by Anthony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May all such wretches be ever punished in the same
manner! and with what can they reproach me?&nbsp; Did I put any
senator to death?&nbsp; Did I pillage the commonwealth?&nbsp; Did
I not return, by my will, what I had amassed and conserved for
her defence?&nbsp; Will they accuse me of tyranny and
usurpation?&nbsp; I, who delivered the Romans from the ambition
of a Pompey?&nbsp; Will they charge me with cruelty?&nbsp; I, who
could not behold without weeping the head of my most inveterate
enemy?&nbsp; Yes, I can truly say, that it was grief at the sad
fate of Pompey, that invited me to declare war against
Egypt.&nbsp; I was desirous of avenging the death of this great
man.&nbsp; He would have made himself master of Rome if I had not
prevented him; and because I stood forth as <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>the
defender of the public liberty, was assassinated as a
usurper.&nbsp; What wickedness!&nbsp; What perfidy!&nbsp; What
cruelty!&nbsp; The senate recognized every thing I had done,
when, after my death, they erected statues, and built me
temples.&nbsp; Infernal judge, will you bear with these impious
men, who killed him whom the empire delighted to
honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicero would have spoken, fearing the eloquence of
C&aelig;sar, or his vehemency, would impose upon the judges; but
C&aelig;sar constantly interrupting him, Lucifer, tired with
their clamours and the length of the cause, ordered that the
emperor, as a punishment for not having profited by the advice he
received on his way to the senate, upon the day of his death,
should remain in his present place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I,&rdquo; said Cicero, &ldquo;who caused this
information to be sent him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Base liar! perfidious man!&rdquo; cried C&aelig;sar,
&ldquo;it was you who gave me this information! why did you not
bring it yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the will of Fate, that Brutus, Cassius, and
other senators, involved in this conspiracy, should be marks for
infamy, as <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>traitors to their country, and as having afforded a
direful example of politicians without courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After him arose Alexander the Great, very much vexed that
C&aelig;sar had spoken before him, and pretending that the cause
of this Roman emperor should not be considered before that of the
emperor of the world; but he abandoned his pretensions, when a
crier had made proclamation, that in hell, all conditions were
equal, and that the damned had among them, no other distinctions
than those of crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Infamous prince,&rdquo; said Clytus, who stood behind
Alexander, &ldquo;dare you speak, after having murdered the best
of your friends?&nbsp; Is not the brightness of thy conquests
tarnished by the shame of thy cruelty?&nbsp; What punishment dost
thou merit, for having despoiled princes so distant from Macedon,
who, so far from having wronged or injured you, did not even know
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; said Alexander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! I be silent! if Lucifer, the chief of this
empire, imposes silence upon me, I <a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span>will obey: but shall I yet receive
orders from you, cruel brigand, notorious robber, sacrilegious
rascal, debauchee, fool, drunkard, incendiary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no: speak, son of Olympias,&rdquo; said Lucifer to
Alexander.</p>
<p>He began thus: &ldquo;Alexander, son of Jupiter Amnion, lord
of the world, most high and mighty emperor, conqueror of the
habitable globe&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clytus laughed at the boasts: &ldquo;what a lord! what an
emperor! what a god!&nbsp; Behold the titles which I
dispute.&nbsp; In the first place, his mother was a virtuous
woman.&nbsp; She but mocked her son, who, through pride, accused
her with having committed adultery with Jupiter Amnion.&nbsp;
Secondly, he was not lord of the world; since he did not conquer
the tenth part of it: and thirdly, it is false that he is a great
emperor; for an emperor is only ennobled by heroic virtues and
qualities, which he did not possess.&nbsp; And how is it possible
that he should be the conqueror of the habitable globe, having
never been neither to Africa, nor very far in Europe, nor to <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>China?&nbsp; Thus he is only Alexander, as I am
Clytus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Lucifer passed an order that this prince should only
assume the titles that veritably pertained to him, and permitted
Clytus to continue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was,&rdquo; said Clytus, &ldquo;the prime favourite
of this Alexander, who, wishing to conquer every body, had no
enemy nearer and more powerful than himself.&nbsp; Contemplate
our portraits: I was his favourite, and I have always seen him as
ambitious of distinction in wickedness as he was for honourable
action: but as a foundation to my complaints against him, I ought
to state, that this prince, elevated by his flatterers to a place
among the gods, was accustomed to speak without respect of Philip
his father.&nbsp; He showed himself more munificent towards
gladiators, musicians, and drunkards, than towards his bravest
captains.&nbsp; In conformity to this disposition, he gave the
kingdom of Sidon to Abdolonymus, a well-digger; he committed
numberless extravagances at the instigation of his mistresses; to
please a courtesan named Roxana, he burnt <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>the palace
of the Persian kings; his conduct towards Parmenio, Philotas, and
Calisthenes, as well as Aminthus, his relation, is sufficient
proof of his barbarity.&nbsp; And did he not exhibit more than
cruelty towards me?&nbsp; I was the most faithful of his
confidants; he who flattered him the least; who gave him the best
of counsel; to whom he owed his reputation and honour.&nbsp;
Alas! because I had the presumption to speak my true sentiments
at a feast, he arose from the table and inflicted upon me a
mortal wound.&nbsp; I now demand expiation.&nbsp; King of hell,
revenge Clytus, punish Alexander.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This prince then replied as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Favourites
bear the same relation to sovereigns as mice to cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this exordium Clytus began to laugh, and said:
&ldquo;Listen to a comparison worthy of the disciple of
Aristotle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mouse,&rdquo; continued Alexander, &ldquo;seems at
first to divert itself with the cat; but finally this animal,
being more powerful, devours the mouse, who cannot accuse her
with cruelty for wishing to take her turn in the sport.&nbsp; <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>Such, about
me, was the condition of Clytus: but to demonstrate the mistake
of this ungrateful favourite, I aver, that it is the policy of
princes to keep favourites, who are towards them neither forward
nor haughty; and not to accord them too much power.&nbsp; The
liberties they take with us cause us to fall into contempt; their
hauteur makes us appear timid, and their power fills us with just
suspicions.&nbsp; Clytus having thus taken advantage of me, I was
frequently ashamed of his familiarities.&nbsp; Such was his
pride, that if I dared to contradict him in the least thing, he
reared up like an unruly horse: my bounty had rendered him so
powerful, that he was in fact Alexander, and I was but
Clytus.&nbsp; In particular, he abused my mistresses, and the
officers of my house; in counsel he was always right and I wrong;
in every battle, it was he that was victorious, and I who had
been slack and timid.&nbsp; If I put some to death, it was but
consonant with justice, to punish the seditious or conspiring; if
I burnt the palace of the kings of Persia, it was for the purpose
of destroying a fortress that had been used against <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>me; if the
pleasures that were indulged in after my conquests were sometimes
too free, it arose from a desire to gratify my generals; in fine,
the death of Clytus crushed those treasonous designs of which I
had notice.&nbsp; He only waited for an opportunity to set one
part of my army against the other, and to despatch me.&nbsp; I
sang at a feast the songs my soldiers had composed upon their
officers and myself; I rallied Clytus for having, in a certain
action, taken to flight: this madman let loose his rage upon me;
he loaded me with contumely; the wine he had drank deprived him
of reason: I thought it was time to punish his audacity, and to
prevent the excesses to which it might carry him.&nbsp; Thus
perished an usurping, traitorous, insolent and unworthy
favourite.&nbsp; Lucifer, I have spoken the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having heard the parties, the king said to his demons,
&ldquo;Take notice how proper it is that a subject should be
faithful and submissive to his prince; and that a favourite
should not go beyond the respect he owes to his sovereign.&nbsp;
<i>We do order</i> that as long as Alexander shall be tormented
by his ambition, <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Clytus shall experience all the remorse that springs
from rashness and ingratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the same moment was heard the voice of Seneca, speaking to
Nero: &ldquo;Cruel prince, how have you profited by the lessons
of clemency, goodness, and humanity I have given you?&nbsp; Did
you not murder me to repossess yourself of the wealth I had
received from you?&nbsp; Such was my recompense for having raised
you to empire.&nbsp; Was it not I who saved you from the
conspiracy formed by Piso, after you had set fire to all quarters
of Rome?&nbsp; Was it not I who delivered you from the snares
which had been spread for you by the friends of your mother
Agrippina, whom you afterwards put to death?&nbsp; I was more
careful of your reputation than yourself, when I advised you not
to exhibit yourself as a comedian upon the theatre; when you
entered the lists to dispute the prize of poetry with Lucan, whom
you afterwards assassinated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old fool,&rdquo; said Nero, in a slender voice,
&ldquo;thou wert become unworthy of my favours by thy excessive
ambition, and by the dishonour <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>you brought upon my palace.&nbsp;
Great Lucifer, you see a man who, being my preceptor, did not
profit by his own theory.&nbsp; He maintained a shameful commerce
with my mother; and with a view to favour it, poisoned the
Emperor Claudius, my father, who did not commit suicide, as was
the prevalent opinion at Rome.&nbsp; The partiality of my mother
filled him with such audacity, that he projected mounting the
throne, and having me poisoned.&nbsp; I was informed of the
intrigue, which I suspected before having received positive
advice.&nbsp; I observed that his immense wealth had obtained him
very many friends among the senators, gentlemen, and officers of
the army; and it is worth while, also, to know, that this man who
preached so much about frugality, and the love of mediocrity, was
far from practising these virtues, which are easily reported of a
man possessing twelve millions of revenue.&nbsp; After having
punished the tyranny and usurpation of my mother, I was bound to
punish the crimes of Seneca; but I was yet lenient enough to
leave the manner of his death to his own choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;The subjects and favourites of princes,&rdquo;
said Lucifer, &ldquo;are always culpable, when they are
ungrateful, or entertain any other desire than the prosperity of
their masters: they ought to leave to them the recompense of
their services, without attempting to reward themselves.&nbsp;
<i>We will</i>, then, that the philosopher, Seneca, born in
Spain, should be punished as if he had compassed his designs upon
Nero: and that Nero be treated as an unjust and barbarous
prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ordinance,&rdquo; said Sejanus, &ldquo;does not
concern me: Tiberius caused me to be assassinated without reason,
actuated by one of those suspicions to which he was usually
addicted.&nbsp; He was troubled more by a fear of losing his
life, than the empire.&nbsp; His courtezans had too much
influence over him.&nbsp; As to myself, I have never punished any
but the enemies of Tiberius: to be sure, they were also
mine.&nbsp; But were not, in truth, the opposers of a minister
who governed as well as I did, foes to their prince and
country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tiberius would have answered; but Lucifer, interrupting him,
ordered that all the <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>favourites of princes should come
in.&nbsp; There appeared a vast number, among them Plautius, the
favourite of Severus, was particularly remarkable: also Faustus,
the favourite of Phyrrhus, king of Epirus; Pyreneus and
Cleandrus, favourites of the emperor Commodus; Cincinnatus,
favourite of Britulus; Rufus, favourite of Domitian; Ampronisius,
favourite of Adrian; Belisarius, favourite of Justinian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Lucifer; &ldquo;the favour of
princes is like quick-silver, the motion of which cannot be
arrested, and which flies the endeavour to restrain it.&nbsp; If
one would sublimate it, it is a vapour that exhales itself; and
often, if too much is used, it becomes dangerous.&nbsp; If one
anoints with it, it penetrates to the very bones: those who are
accustomed to draw it from the mine, and purify it, contract a
malady which makes them tremble all their lives.&nbsp; This is
the character of princes&rsquo; favour: it is inconstant, because
it depends upon the humour and passion of one who seeks only
novelty and the pleasure of the moment.&nbsp; If you are
importunate, if you exhibit the least sign of impatience, if you
are even suspected of prudence in the <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>management of your credit or
fortune, the attachment of the prince will cool.&nbsp; If you
show any marks of envy against another, of discontent in
yourself, or indifference in the presence of your protector, he
suspects you, and passes straightway from suspicion to enmity and
hatred.&nbsp; Bear then with resignation your bad fortune and the
humour of your master: your pains, attentions, time, health,
wealth all lost, you are at length obliged to return into your
humble retreat, there to expect death; which, to your grief,
comes not soon enough to free you from regret and the remembrance
of your follies.&nbsp; A casual sally, an instant of good humor,
a lucky word, a sudden caprice, a nothing, makes a
favourite.&nbsp; Five or six years suffice for his fortune; if
delayed, it escapes him.&nbsp; The same causes can bestow or
withdraw favour.&nbsp; A favourite ought to make these
reflections in his prosperity,&mdash;that he must abstain from
those liberties that are common among equals, and that freedom
which friends indulge in; that he must be constantly submissive,
and know how to accompany respect with complaisance; that the <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>prince
ought always to speak the first word in a confidential affair;
and to preserve his secrets, he must dispose himself to every
kind of privation.&nbsp; He who hath not regulated his conduct by
these precepts must bear the burden of his own imprudence; and
for this reason <i>we order</i> that those favourites who have
incurred the displeasure of their sovereigns shall be punished as
unfaithful subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucifer then commanded an old man to advance, whom he
perceived in the hall behind the others.&nbsp; There advanced
then a man of a pleasant countenance, in a Greek habit, and
followed by other persons clothed in the same manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Solon,&rdquo; said this old man: &ldquo;I gave to
the Athenians laws which they did not exactly follow; this person
contiguous to me is the philosopher Anaxarchus, whom the tyrant
Nicocreon caused to be brayed in a mortar: in this little
hump-back, behold the famous Aristotle, preceptor to the great
Alexander: his philosophy excused the disciple from practising
the morality he taught.&nbsp; This academician is Socrates, whom
his fellow <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>citizens put to death with a cup of hemlock.&nbsp; This
old man is the divine Plato, who, spite of the sublimity of his
doctrine, sold oil for the defrayment of his expenses.&nbsp; All
the rest are men of letters, who, like ourselves, have excited
the envy, and experienced the vengeance of the princes, Archons
and Tyrants, of Athens; and it is now upon these tyrants we
unitedly demand vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Denis, the tyrant, accompanied by some other princes,
presented themselves and spoke in this manner:&mdash;&ldquo;Of
whom do these old dotards complain?&nbsp; Infatuated by their
conceits, they pretended to dictate law to the whole world!&nbsp;
In fact they had so imbued the people with their dogmas and their
customs, that when we wished to make some changes, they excited
sedition.&nbsp; They had so much pride and presumption, that they
arrogated to themselves alone the possession of common sense and
reason; while in truth they were distinguished but for opinions
founded upon vain subtleties, and by a language not common and
familiar to men:&mdash;and now I should like to ask them what
certain knowledge they had; <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>what was their idea upon the nature
of the soul? and what constituted the reason and equity of their
laws?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will add to that,&rdquo; said Julian, the apostate,
&ldquo;that there are pedants, who, under the affectation of
austerity, concealed the most extreme ambition.&nbsp; Do they
complain of the contempt that was shown them, when their manner
of living exposed them to it?&nbsp; Will they speak of their
poverty, who would not labour for a living?&nbsp; The people of
letters deceive themselves if they believe that princes and the
public ought to enrich them for vain and useless sciences.&nbsp;
Should they not make their calculation for that, when, idle in
their cabinets, they amuse themselves in contemplating the
figures and number of the stars, which they apply, to find fault
with the common prejudices of our ancestors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; observed Cato of Utica, &ldquo;you
cannot make those remarks with regard to Cicero, or myself, who
have exercised the highest magistracies of Rome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old fox,&rdquo; answered Julian, &ldquo;I cannot, it is
true, say so of you two; for if you were <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>attached to
letters, you were still more so to your fortunes.&nbsp; And of
whom can you complain, you who accelerated your own death?&nbsp;
Did you not hope to gain an easy immortality in thus quitting
your terrestrial abode?&nbsp; It was to arrive at this, that you
did not wish to survive the pretended misfortunes of your
country.&nbsp; Fine courage that, of a man who kills himself to
escape fighting with his enemies!&nbsp; Would you not have done
better to have preserved yourselves for the defence of Rome, its
liberty, and your goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recommend you,&rdquo; said Cato, &ldquo;to the
Antiochians: they will tell the truth of you better than I can:
they know you; they are fully acquainted with your pusillanimity,
your vices, but, above all, with your vanity, which surpasses
your knowledge and eloquence.&nbsp; Look at this great emperor,
who, to punish Antioch, quits the sword, assumes the pen, and is,
after all, nothing but an ignoramus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am called Suetonius,&rdquo; said he, who presented
himself next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Suetonius,&rdquo; said the emperor <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>Domitian,
who was at his side; &ldquo;this is that notorious forger, and
compiler of histories and chronicles, who, after the example of
other historians, being a partisan and a flatterer, speaks the
truth from caprice, and lies from inclination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; said Suetonius; &ldquo;I have said nothing
that I cannot prove by indubitable evidence.&nbsp; Is it not
true, that upon the testimony of vile informers, you have taken
from the living, the estates of the dead who were accused?&nbsp;
Is it not true that you have levied upon your subjects tributes
so enormous, that they were forced to claim protection from a
foreign power?&nbsp; Is it not true that you have despoiled the
Jews of their goods only because they were born Jews?&nbsp; Is it
then a crime to have been circumcised at birth and not to adore
the gods of the Roman empire?&nbsp; Is it not true that by your
excessive expenses for theatres, and buildings, you have
exhausted the purses of the Romans, and left to perish with
hunger the bravest soldiers of the army?&nbsp; To escape the
consequences of a sedition, you committed horrible pillages, and
thus paid your debts.&nbsp; <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>Your pride and impiety are exhibited
in these few words, extracted from one of your declarations:
&lsquo;<i>Your Lord</i>, <i>your God</i>,&rsquo; commands
thus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What signifies that?&rdquo; said Domitian: &ldquo;Are
not the emperors gods as well during their lives as after their
death?&nbsp; Were not Augustus and C&aelig;sar adored in the
empire?&nbsp; I was as much a god at the time I willed it, as my
predecessors have been gods after their death.&nbsp; The divinity
of men is nothing but a power superior to that of others, as the
present divinity of Augustus is but a perfection above the
virtues and qualities of living men.&nbsp; But who, among men of
sense, has ever believed that the gods were like men? or adored
in the statue any thing more than the virtue of the
original?&nbsp; Who ever believed that the number of gods was
equal to their names, their temples, or their statues?&nbsp; No,
no, Suetonius, you did not believe all this, and it is from
perfidiousness that you have accused me of impiety for being
called a god.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your unjust vexations,&rdquo; replied
Suetonius.</p>
<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;As it regards that,&rdquo; said the emperor,
&ldquo;subjects who cannot penetrate the designs of their
sovereigns always consider the tributes imposed upon them as
unjust; but if enemies were about to inundate the kingdom; if the
empire was menaced with approaching ruin; if there was danger of
the pillage and sack of frontier cities, would not the prince
have reason to take measures for the prevention of these
disasters by a heavier levy, and a stronger assemblage of
troops?&nbsp; If I had apprized the Romans of these things, which
I had learned by my spies, they would have been more likely to
have risen against myself, than against the common enemy: so
powerful is the voice of interest with the multitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Lucifer interrupted the emperor and ordered all the
historians, historiographers, authors of journals, of memoirs and
chronicles, to advance, to listen to their sentence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for the public interest,
that mendacity should be punished in writers, as in those who
speak falsely; but it is of equal interest that writers should be
permitted to speak the truth, without flattery and without <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>fear, to
the end, that men by reading the history of their ancestors, may
learn to become good, and detest the conduct of the unjust.&nbsp;
Although it is crime that brings us subjects, <i>we wish</i>,
nevertheless, that it should be punished in our empire; and it is
that which constitutes the justice of the torments they
feel.&nbsp; A prince flatters himself in vain with a fine and
secret policy, if his subjects are rendered unhappy by the rules
he has prescribed for their conduct; whatever colour he may take
to cover his actions, and make them appear just, if they are not
so in effect, which the event proves, he expects in vain the
approbation, the esteem and love of his subjects.&nbsp; The
writer who undertakes a history ought to divest himself of the
sentiments of both love and hatred; he ought to have no
partiality for country, relations or friends; he is the sole
judge of the affairs of which he treats, and the master of
princes when he describes their actions.&nbsp; Accordingly, <i>we
ordain</i>, that Domitian and the other princes shall submit to
the judgments of their historians; that the historians shall be
punished for flatteries and lies; <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>for the examination of which, we
order them before the tribunals of conscience, to whom we
delegate plenary authority for the decision of their cases; and
as a judgment upon the geometricians, geographers, astronomers,
and mathematicians, we condemn the one party to measure by
minutes, seconds, and lines, the dimensions of all the provinces,
kingdoms, and empires of the earth; and the others to be shut up
in the planets upon which they have pretended to make
observations, to the end that they may be instructed by their
experience.&nbsp; Furthermore we decree, that afterwards, the
aforesaid geometricians, geographers, astronomers, and
mathematicians, to be there punished for their foolish and rash
opinions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audience having now lasted a considerable time, Lucifer
commanded something to eat to be brought into the middle of the
hall.&nbsp; Forthwith there appeared a vast number of
chirurgians, cooks of hell, with an almost equal number of
apothecaries, having the title of confectioners to the
devil.&nbsp; They set forth a great table of gold, upon which
they placed <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>a vast quantity of silver plate: they informed me that
this table and plate had been fabricated with the gold and silver
stolen, and afterwards sold to the goldsmiths.&nbsp; I have never
any where seen such a quantity of linen: it proceeded from the
thefts committed by linen dealers and washer women; for all that
is stolen upon earth, goes into hell after the second or third
generation of thieves.&nbsp; They served for the first course a
heap of tailors roasted upon the spit.&nbsp; Lucifer is very fond
of this meal; and the expression, &ldquo;<i>may the devil swallow
me</i>,&rdquo; which the tailors often use, is not inappropriate;
for he does swallow many; and the demons, his table companions,
do the same: the subjects always having tastes similar to those
of their masters, be they good or bad.&nbsp; I inquired of one of
the demons, why his infernal majesty devoured more tailors than
cooks, sausage makers, butchers, peruquiers, in short, people of
other trades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for a very politic
reason; for otherwise he would soon want subjects of any other
description; those of other trades are by far the least in
number, while <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>the others are so plenty, that if we could eat them all
in one day, the morrow would supply as many more: they arrive
continually, in one eternal troop.&nbsp; Sometimes in beholding
them afar off, we imagine them to be entire armies, coming to
besiege us: this trade is more useful in hell, than you would be
apt to think: we send among the tailors, young devils without
experience: their shops are so many academies for our
youth.&nbsp; If you had nice eyes, you might perceive more than
fifty young demons in each tailor shop; some cut the cloth;
others the list; these take away the superfluous pieces; those
put them in the place they call the <i>street</i>; while some do
nothing but open and shut the place they call the
<i>eye</i>.&nbsp; Some carry the cabbaged pieces to sell; others
make complete suits out of the patterns cut from the cloth; in
fine, there are many about the women, girls, and valets of the
tailor, to assist them in stealing the cloth, or stretching the
binding.&nbsp; When these young devils have finished their
diabolical apprenticeship, they are sent to the merchants.&nbsp;
In that station they abridge all the measures, and <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>sometimes
throw themselves into the scale, among the merchandise, to make
it weigh more: if you could see all their tricks, you would be
highly amused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this course was removed from the table, they served
another of tailors, roasted upon the gridiron: after that,
others, baked in pates, smothered in a pot, fried in a pan, and
dressed in a hundred different ways, with this only difference,
that those of each nation had a particular dressing.&nbsp; The
French tailors were spitted; the English, grilled; the Holland,
fried; the Germans, smothered in a pot; the Italians, made into
ragout; the Spanish, boiled, because they are ordinarily hard;
the Polonese, in pates; the Hungarians, salad; the Turks, cooked
in rice; the Greeks, in wine; the Arabians, dried in the sun; the
Egyptians, with onion sauce; the Algerines, fried in lard; the
Portuguese, preserved in sugar; the Danish, Swedish, and
Muscovite, were almost all dressed in the same manner; that is to
say, baked in brandy; the Tartar, boiled in horse grease; the
Persian, fricaseed with gravy <i>de demon</i>; the Indians, baked
in <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>bananas; the Chinese, and all the islanders, were very
much seasoned with spices and sugar; the Ethiopians, negroes of
Fez, Morocco, and Guinea, were baked in black butter; and the
Americans, in milk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an immense quantity of tailors,&rdquo; said I to
the demon who was near me; &ldquo;your cooks must understand
their business, to be able to compound so many dishes of viands,
which differ no more the one from the other, than the bullocks of
Spain from those of Ireland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They served to Lucifer wine of the various publicans of the
world.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fie!&rdquo; said I to the demon; &ldquo;your
master is hardly a connoisseur of wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;it is true,
that this wine has been mixed with water, sugar, and spices; but
the publicans are obliged to separate all these drugs, even the
water which they ordinarily put in, from the rest, which remains
pure, fair and clear; if the publicans did not do this, they
would put them in the press, and draw from their veins all the
wine they had themselves drank.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;do you live upon
nothing but human flesh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should we live else?&rdquo; answered he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can we eat beef, mutton, partridges, fish, and
beans?&nbsp; These animals come not hither, but in smoke; and
herbs will not grow in a place so hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you say that animals come here in
smoke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is those the idolaters sacrifice to the prince of
demons: this smoke penetrates even to this place, and is the only
perfume agreeable to our sovereign; for as to the scented oils,
powders, and pomatums, of which the men and women of the other
life make use, Lucifer is so incommoded, that those who are thus
scented, dare not approach his apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad!&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Lucifer has then a smell
keener than that of a hound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes: he has so fine a scent, that he instantly knows
whether a girl has been cautious or not; whether she has been
married, or not, and the exact number of times: and the other day
there came here a <i>menette</i>, who <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>made a profession of
<i>menettisme</i>, wearing the habits, air, <i>et cetera</i>: she
wanted to make every thing appear smooth, saying, that she had
been sent here for having administered to herself the discipline,
contrary to the direction of her directors: but the prince
approaching her, perceived, and said immediately, that this
habit, modest as it was, covered much indevotion, sacrilege,
gallantry, and falsehood.&nbsp; The young girl retired abashed;
she had not imagined that any person could discover, under the
exterior of such simplicity, what she had been guilty of, during
her life; you see Lucifer has an exquisite nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;the other senses in a
similar perfection, he well merits the commandery of
hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the mean time, Lucifer, and the other lords, invited to his
table, continued to eat with good appetite: besides the
individuals of his council, there were a great number whom I
heard designated by the names given to the gods of fable, such as
Jupiter, Saturn, Apollo, Mercury: and to goddesses, such as Juno,
Venus, Diana, Proserpina, and others; <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>I should think there were at least
fifty persons at table.&nbsp; These gods and goddesses were men
and women, like the others; and in reflecting upon that
circumstance, I thought they were princesses and princes, whom
the people had put in the place of gods.&nbsp; But these ignorant
people deceive themselves; for their gods, instead of being in
heaven, are in hell.&nbsp; The same thing often happens in the
world; a particular person is looked upon as a man of honour, who
is, in fact, worse than one whom they consider the most knavish;
another as a good man, who, in truth, is one of the worst; they
frequently speak of one as happy after death, whose lot, if they
did but know it, is quite the contrary: this is the sentiment of
saint Pere, who said, &ldquo;they peopled heaven with the
inhabitants of hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The dessert served up to this
great demon, was very pleasant to behold: it consisted of
hypocrites, bigots, and apostate monks, all preserved in sugar:
in the middle of it was a country seat in sugar: one could
perceive the chateau, with its fosses, garden, park, wood,
closes, vineyards, fish-ponds, fountains, jets of water, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>mill,
stables, and farms; the whole being executed in the most perfect
symmetry of architecture.</p>
<p>The demon observing my surprise, told me, the devil usually
devoured goods unjustly acquired: &ldquo;have you not,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;heard it remarked, that property illy gotten,
failed not <i>to go to the devil</i>?&nbsp; It comes to us; for
be it known to you, that what is lost in the world, falls down
here.&nbsp; You can find in our magazines things of every
description: the entire shops of merchants, stores of grain and
wine, tons of silver, an arsenal filled with arms, cabinets of
jewellery and precious stones, tablets covered with antique
medals, a kind of pantheon, filled with idols of gold, silver,
and bronze, which you have no doubt seen at the houses of
antiquaries: for the fruits of larcenies, spunging, and usury,
always come straight to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the desert, the Jews and Turks brought coffee, tea,
chocolate, tobacco, aqua vit&aelig;, liquors, and opium.&nbsp;
The lords drank of all, and Jupiter partook so freely of tobacco
and brandy, that he became quite elevated: <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>he began to
sing a song in the Greek language, the substance of which was:
&ldquo;What a charming spectacle for the mighty Lucifer! the dead
dispersed throughout this cavern, are to him delicious
meats.&nbsp; Subtle Love, and you gods of combat, theft, and
drunkenness, contribute to content the taste and desires of our
sovereign.&nbsp; So long as one remains in Tartarus, he must not
hope for any other pleasure; we must not think of objects to be
procured in other places.&rdquo;&mdash;While Jupiter repeated
this song, Juno accompanied him, saying: &ldquo;So long as one
regains in Tartarus, he must not hope for any other
pleasure.&nbsp; Lovers, you enhance our joy, for death hath
separated you for ever.&rdquo;&mdash;In imitation of Jupiter and
Juno, Mercury and Mars sang thus: &ldquo;Yes, while one remains
in Tartarus, he cannot hope for other pleasures.&nbsp; The money
which was our love, is lost for ever: we love it still, but
despairing of enjoyment.&rdquo;&mdash;Mars, with a voice of
thunder, sang.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, when one is in Tartarus, he must
not hope for other pleasures.&nbsp; War, which was our delight,
is no more for us, but a vain flourish: here one hears neither
fife nor drum.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>After
this little concert, which amused Lucifer, he made them call the
players upon instruments, who joined the gods and
goddesses.&nbsp; There was then heard the most frightful music:
with the sound of violins and other instruments, which were
played upon by those who had been musicians in the other world,
there mingled a horrid noise of thunder, and raging wind, such as
it produces when it rushes through a straight street, or groans,
amid a wood of firs.&nbsp; This noise was succeeded by another,
like that which is heard at the eruption of Mount Vesuvius or
Etna: my ear was struck with a bellowing, like that of the sea,
when agitated by a furious tempest.&nbsp; All these agents
yielded to a choir of voices, that issued from the lowest depths:
there was heard nothing but complaints, groans, cries, and
howlings, similar to those of dogs, impatient of
confinement.&nbsp; I should have expired with fear, if I had not
been previously warned, that this was the music which would
divert the prince of hell.&nbsp; Jupiter and Mars, in spite of
their intrepidity, found this music so disagreeable, that they
ceased singing, and <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>signified their uneasiness to
Lucifer.&nbsp; They then removed the table, and the service of
plate; and the audience having been resumed, they began to call
up cases of different states; and after having disposed of those
pertaining to the people of justice, the sword, and the church,
they cited the women of all conditions.&nbsp; The beautiful Helen
then appeared, who complained that at her return from the siege
of Troy, she had been condemned to be hung by Polixo, her
relation, at whose house, in the isle of Rhodes, she had taken
refuge, Nisistratus and Megapontus having driven her from
Greece.&nbsp; She was asked if she had consented to be abducted
by Paris; if she had accorded him the last favours before leaving
Peloponessus; if she had granted the same to the king of Egypt,
when his vessel touched at her country.&nbsp; She answered
ingenuously to these questions, that having been married by
policy and force, to prince Menelaus, she had acquainted him that
she did not love him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you love,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;the Trojan
prince before marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;I had not then seen him; but my heart was never
for Menclaus; it was free when Paris came to Argos, and its first
impression was in favour of this stranger prince.&nbsp; Am I
culpable for all the evils caused by the siege of Troy?&nbsp;
Furthermore, the Greeks ought not to complain of this abduction,
as a breach of hospitality: some years before, they had taken
away a Trojan lady; and in ancient times, had not Jupiter, of
Grecian origin, stolen Europa, a young princess of Asia, from
this part of the world, inhabited by Trojans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Menelaus spoke after his wife, whose ingratitude and
infidelity he exaggerated; he accused her of having poisoned him
on the return from Troy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why assassinate me, when
she had the liberty to go to her relations?&nbsp; Could I have
done more to express my regret at her loss, after her elopement,
than by building to her memory a temple, consecrated to
Venus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very clever man,&rdquo; said Jupiter to
Menelaus; &ldquo;who told you that a husband could make his wife
love him by caresses and services?&nbsp; A woman who does not
love <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>her
husband, takes all his cares for stratagems, invented by
jealousy: she believes him false and wicked.&nbsp; Accuse only
your patience and weakness; and between ourselves who are dead,
since the living cannot hear it, it is a very good joke, to make
so much noise about the infidelity of a coquette:&rdquo; and
Jupiter sang a song, the burden of which was, that one was often
very happy to be rid of his wife, as he then could enjoy the
advantages of liberty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I permitted to be as stoical as you are?&rdquo; said
Menelaus.&nbsp; &ldquo;One must have a great force of spirit, to
vanquish a passion like that of love: how cruel, to love without
return!&nbsp; Ah! I now condemn myself: let Helen prosecute her
quarrel with her relation Polixo, to which I am a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since this Grecian prince is voluntarily
condemned,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;I am about to pass
sentence upon the husbands who have complained of their wives;
and upon the wives who have complained of their
husbands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judgment was couched in these words: <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>&ldquo;Since love is natural, and no one can dictate a
woman&rsquo;s will, and since neither the jealousy nor severity
of a husband are of any avail, to compel a wife to conjugal
fidelity, we order, that all husbands shall suffer the pain of
foolish and indiscreet love, without having from that any
pretence to restrain them; provided, however, that they may
revenge themselves with chance intrigues, and contribute, by
their patience and complaisance, to the ruin of their
rivals.&nbsp; We ordain, also, that women who complain of the
amours of their husbands, shall be condemned to the torments of
jealousy; with an equal permission to those ladies who are not
beloved by their husbands, to receive the cares and attentions of
their neighbours.&nbsp; Finally, we forbid the married of both
sexes, to bring any more actions upon these subjects, and reject
them, in advance, from court.&nbsp; We command our demons, and
principally Asmodeus, the demon of marriage, to bear in hand the
execution of the present ordinance.&nbsp; Given in hell, at the
grand audience hall, to be signified to whom it may
concern.&mdash;Signed, <i>Lucifer</i>, king of <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>hell: and
countersigned by my lord, the devil <i>Patiras</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Signor,&rdquo; said Cleopatra, &ldquo;this edict cannot
prejudice my rights against Augustus, emperor of the Romans: his
ambition prompted him to attach to his triumphal car the queen of
the Egyptians: to save myself from this shame, I laid violent
hands upon myself.&nbsp; I demand that Augustus should be
punished as guilty of my death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I responsible for your actions?&rdquo; said
Augustus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who informed you that I should put this
indignity upon you?&nbsp; C&aelig;sar had loved you; Pompey also,
as I believe: that Antony did, no one can doubt.&nbsp; The
reputation of those charms by which you had subdued the
conquerors of the world, had made such an impression upon my
heart, that I would not only have made you its governor, but have
re-established you upon the throne of your ancestors; but the
timidity so natural to your sex, pride, and haughtiness, misled
you: the poison you employed to produce death was so subtle, that
I could never discover its nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>&ldquo;All! tyrant,&rdquo; said Antony to Augustus,
&ldquo;you were not satisfied with having at the same time caused
my death and the loss of my empire; but you must also effect the
death of my spouse, whom I preferred to the throne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I deny that,&rdquo; replied Augustus; &ldquo;you
abandoned the field of battle to follow Cleopatra; yourself
commanded a servant to give the blow of death, to prevent falling
into my hands; it was in conformity to your counsel that
Cleopatra killed herself; great Lucifer, I am innocent of these
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ordain,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;that both
parties should be delivered to their remorse of conscience; if
they are not satisfied with this judgment, let them present
themselves before Astarte, sovereign of women, to whom Venus and
Pallas are associated, where their cases shall be more amply
examined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There came next a queen, accompanied by many women and girls,
armed as soldiers: this was said to be the foundress of the
kingdom of the Amazons.&nbsp; To this troop, Zenobia, queen of
Palmyra, Elizabeth, queen of England, <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>and other princesses who had
governed their states, joined themselves.&nbsp; Amazonide,
daughter of Samornas, (so they called the foundress of this
female monarchy,) complained against Hercules that he had made
some of her subjects captive: against Theseus, who had married
one, when their army was defeated in Greece; against Achilles,
who had put to death the princess Orythia, for having succoured
the Trojans; against Alexander the Great, because, not content
with the favours he had received from the queen Thalestris, he
had put her kingdom under contribution; against the Ephesians,
who, for their ingratitude towards the Amazons, who had founded
their city, were themselves delivered to other masters: and thus
in the same manner against many other princes and people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Illustrious women,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;a sex so
fragile as yours, a monarchy so naturally given to tenderness,
could not resist the force of men, nor get away from an empire so
sweet as that of love.&nbsp; You have wished to act contrary to
your destiny: made to submit, <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>you have desired to command; but
women cannot reign but by submissions to the laws of love; that
renders men completely amenable to the will of woman.&nbsp; If
men have done you wrong, accuse your own hearts; they have done
the injury of which you complain.&nbsp; A warrior, proud and
gallant, is full of ardour for victory when a fair Amazon is the
price of conquest; and on the other hand an Amazon fears to
vanquish a young soldier whose amiable qualities have now
disarmed her.&nbsp; So we re-commit to yourselves the examination
of those affairs you have brought to our tribunal: do yourselves
the justice I should do, if I examined the matter with more care,
and let all women be convinced, they have no greater enemies than
their own hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zenobia then took the stand, and said to Lucifer, that her
heart had never been master of her head: &ldquo;I lost,&rdquo;
continued she, &ldquo;my husband Odenatus, for whom I had the
purest attachment: although he left me young, my subjects were
willing to obey me.&nbsp; During the thirty years of my
government, I can <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>now say, that I maintained my sway with as much
mildness as wisdom.&nbsp; When the thirty tyrants under Galienus
divided the empire, I took possession of a province in Syria,
that had formerly been separated, and united it to my
kingdom.&nbsp; Aurelian declared war against me, and having taken
me captive, led me in chains behind his triumphal car.&nbsp; In
the endeavour to overcome the fidelity with which I preserved the
memory of my spouse, and which was my sole consolation for the
loss of my crown, he exiled me, under a specious pretext, into
the Tybertine country; but he could not vanquish my
constancy.&nbsp; Spite and rage seized him; he put to death
Herennianus and Timolaus, my two sons, whom I had myself brought
up; I had given them an excellent education, and had taught them
the Egyptian, Greek and Latin languages; it was for their use,
that I had compiled an abridgment of the oriental history, and
that of Alexandria.&nbsp; What was my grief at seeing myself
deprived of two children, who would have perpetuated my name, and
honoured my blood upon the throne of Palmyra!&nbsp; Let no <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>one boast
to me of the liberality of this prince towards his subjects: I am
aware that he often distributed among them clothing, corn, wine
and oil: but this virtue was tarnished by his avarice towards
strangers.&nbsp; Could he not be contented with the boundaries of
the Roman empire, which was a world of itself, in which one could
make voyages both by land and sea?&nbsp; And why should I not
accuse him of the murder of my two sons, since he even put to
death the son of his sister?&nbsp; His cruel jealousy might well
extend itself to the children of a queen whom he had
ruined.&nbsp; Justice, god of hell! do not suffer Zenobia to
remain under the tyranny of this haughty emperor; for even here,
he pretends to exercise it over me.&nbsp; Does not death reduce
to an equality monarchs and their subjects, conquerors and their
slaves?&nbsp; A distinguished Roman poet has said, &lsquo;he
knocks, without distinction, at the gates of palaces and
huts.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lucifer, hell, remorse, eternity, do me
justice for these grievous tyrannies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak Aurelian,&rdquo; said Lucifer; &ldquo;what
prerogative do you pretend over this princess?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>The
emperor answered in this manner: &ldquo;Aurelian, emperor of the
Romans, pontifex maximus, consul, censor, augur, tribune of the
people, supreme head of Germany, Parthia, Persia, Arabia,
Scythia, and Africa, to Lucifer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay aside these vain titles,&rdquo; said Belial, who
sat near Lucifer: &ldquo;could not the scurviest beggar who had
traversed with his pack, for a living, the various countries of
the globe, assume as many with as much propriety?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must then be but plain Aurelian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not consent to it; and I had rather be condemned
than not to affix my titles to the head of my defence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This emperor having declined answering, Lucifer accorded to
queen Zenobia what she had demanded.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, queen of England, then came forward: she complained
of the count of Essex, who slighted her affections at the time
she was sought by all the princes of Europe.&nbsp; Lucifer
referred her to the tribunal of Astarte, where he had sent the
Amazons.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>After
her appeared Dido, queen of Carthage.&nbsp; She testified great
dissatisfaction at Virgil, who had represented her as enamoured
with a man she had never seen.&mdash;Referred to the same
tribunal.</p>
<p>Sappho also was in court: she averred that there had never
been any other Sappho than herself, who was born in the Island of
Mitylene: had given her name to the sapphic poetry, and was the
author of poems dedicated to her friend Phaon, one of which had
been translated by Ovid.</p>
<p>The other Sappho declared that she was the true, the only
Sappho who had existed; that she was born at Erise, in the time
of the elder Tarquin, king of Rome; that she had married Cersyla,
of Andros, one of the ancestors of the muse Clio; and that she
had composed poems of different kinds.&nbsp; The claims of Sappho
of Mitylene were then recognized, and the other forbidden to
assume this name, or any work thereunto appertaining, because the
property of a wife belonged to her husband: and according to the
laws of all nations, her acts ought to appear in his name.</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>Sappho having been confirmed in her rights, accused
Phaon of coldness and ingratitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;When,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;I had given him my heart, I was no more mistress of
myself; I wished by my works to immortalize my love and his name:
hard as the rocks of Parnassus, inflexible as the fiercest dog of
Thessaly, impenetrable as the isthmus of Corinth, he disdained my
flame; my verse made no impression upon him; weary of my love, he
sought but to escape from me; insensible to my anguish, when I
threw myself from the precipice of Leucadia, he manifested no
sorrow.&nbsp; O, rage!&nbsp; O, fury of love! avenge my
wrongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucifer ordained that Sappho should present her case before
the goddess of females.</p>
<p>Artemisa rehearsed all she had done to eternise the memory of
her spouse: she repeated a hundred times the name of her dear
Mausoleus, and demanded that he should be again restored to her,
since she had died for love of him.</p>
<p>The matron of Ephesus, who stood near her, began to laugh
loudly, at the idea of a <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>woman&rsquo;s demanding her lost
husband from hell.</p>
<p>Both of them being adjudged fools, for contrary reasons, were
remanded to their dungeons.</p>
<p>Lucretia, a Roman lady, succeeded them; she demanded justice
against Tarquin, who, by her violation, had been the cause of her
death.&nbsp; Jupiter, who wished to amuse himself, asked her if
she had made any resistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hindered you from stabbing Tarquin as he
approached you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the stronger party, and would have killed
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there ever seen a man, who could, unassisted, force
a woman to the gratification of his lust?&nbsp; Why did you not
rather suffer death, than permit him to consummate his
enterprise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are so importunate, that I must needs avow the
truth: Collatinus, my husband, discovering my intrigues with the
young prince, <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>poinarded me, and then spread a false report, to
advance the designs of Brutus and himself.&nbsp; This
Jupiter,&rdquo; murmured she, retiring, very angry, &ldquo;is an
impertinent&mdash;he will not believe that any woman could be
capable of so heroic an action as that attributed to me, and that
they are all coquettes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let all the women,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;betake
themselves to the tribunal established for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
then gave orders for the approach of four princes, who craved
audience: the first was Darius, who impleaded Alexander the
Great: the second, Bajazet, who accused Tamerlane of robbery: the
third, Constantine Paleologus, who reproached Mahomet with his
cruelty and ambition; the fourth, Montezuma, king of Mexico, who
complained against Fernandez Cortes, and the usurpation of the
Spaniards.&nbsp; The three first replied, custom, and the laws of
war: as to the last, he was listened to, more from curiosity than
any intention to reinstate him in his possessions.</p>
<p>Montezuma spake very nearly in these words: &ldquo;I was
formerly the legitimate and peaceful possessor of the Mexican
states, <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>which my fathers had enjoyed from the universal deluge,
if not before; for there are people called <i>preadamites</i>,
who maintain, that God created men in that part of the world
called <i>America</i>, who did not descend from the first man
born in Asia, and whom they called <i>Adam</i>.&nbsp; The avarice
and temerity of certain merchants, led them across the immense
sea, which separates America from Europe; they represented
themselves as persons, who, having been shipwrecked, had need of
succour: we gave them firs, wood, and silver; we aided them to
the extent of our power.&nbsp; All these gifts, which ought to
have served for the establishment of an honourable commerce and
friendship, only inflamed their cupidity and avarice.&nbsp; We
were their friends; they made us their vassals, after having
combatted us with arms, of which we were ignorant: mounted on
horses of which we were horribly afraid, they put us to flight
with the terrible noise of their cannon; having rallied, we
assembled all our troops; they prevailed by the superiority of
their arms; shutting us up in villages, they <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>besieged,
they massacred, they took us captive, and carried all before
them, with fire and sword.&nbsp; Regardless of royal majesty,
which I held of God, they took my life.&nbsp; If it is right to
usurp the goods and estate of another, why do not subjects war
against their sovereigns?&nbsp; Why do not families seek the
downfall of families?&nbsp; Why do not the wicked and strong
dominate, the one over the weak, and the other take away their
goods?&nbsp; Natural right, which bestows every thing that hath
no owner, was it upon the side of the king of Spain, or on mine,
who had received the kingdom of Mexico, as an inheritance from my
fathers?&nbsp; The civil law, which maintains possession, and
which protects legitimate proprietors, was it in favour of the
king of Spain, or in mine?&nbsp; The reason of all ages and
countries accuse the Spaniards.&nbsp; We learn in childhood, that
we must not do to others, what we would not have them to do to
us; Did I carry war into Spain?&nbsp; Why then have they brought
it to me, and that too, in a country where they had experienced
the cares of hospitality, to destroy a prodigious number of <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>men?&nbsp;
What horrible ingratitude! what frightful injustice! what
atrocious cruelty!&nbsp; Lucifer, be the avenger of one half the
world: punish the Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fernandez Cortes excused himself on the score of orders from
the king, his master: he confessed that reason, humanity, and
justice, spake by the mouth of Montezuma; but he observed, that
the conquests of the Spaniards had instructed the Indians in the
knowledge of the true God.</p>
<p>Upon that, Montezuma cried out, that the design of the
Spaniards was not to eradicate idolatry in America, but solely to
enrich Spain, at the expense of that part of the world; that this
was so true, that in Mexico, the christian Spaniards and their
slaves, did not compose more than one hundred thousandth part of
the inhabitants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you desire,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;that I
should do to the Spaniards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not demand,&rdquo; said the prince, &ldquo;to be
reinstated in my dominions; some day, perhaps, one of my
descendants, or some generous Indian, will deliver my country
from <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>the
Spanish yoke; I wish only that the Indians who were killed in the
conquest of Mexico, should have the liberty to roast upon spits,
and eat their cruel enemies; and in this manner my nation shall
be sufficiently revenged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We accord to Montezuma,&rdquo; said Lucifer, &ldquo;the
Spaniards who conquered Mexico, with the exception of the
tailors, whom we reserve for our own table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that came an abbot, who took the title of ten abbeys,
besides priories, and eighteen cures.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo;
said Lucifer, &ldquo;an abbot, with as many titles as a Roman
emperor: speak, of whom do you complain? had you not a sufficient
income to live honourably in the world, according to your
degree?&nbsp; How have you employed your revenue?&nbsp; Play,
women, good cheer, horses, dogs, equipage, dress, and relations,
have eaten it.&nbsp; You demand, without doubt, justice against
the authors of your ruin: I grant it amply and promptly.&nbsp;
For the mortification of your enemies, I surrender you to the
troop of beggars who throng the avenues of my palace, and who
would not have been damned, if, by alms <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>which would
have cost you but little, you had removed from them the necessity
of becoming thieves and robbers: go, learn in hell to spend but
little yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minettes, the bigots, and hypocrites, demanded
audience.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are very pleasant people,&rdquo;
said Lucifer to Jupiter; &ldquo;they will divert us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An Italian comic writer,&rdquo; said one of them,
&ldquo;has burlesqued us, as if it was wrong to <i>seem</i>
honest men in the public eye.&nbsp; When one has not the
substance of virtue, is it reprehensible to set a good
example?&nbsp; It is true, that if our lives, hidden under this
cloak, had been exposed, our hypocrisy and spurious piety would
have been easily detected; but we injured no person, and if any
one was scandalized by our example, it was for conscience
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Italian writer, who happened to be present, and whom I had
not before perceived, cried out, &ldquo;satyrists of France and
Italy, our cause is common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Immediately there appeared a number of comic writers, ranged
under their respective <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>masters, among whom I saw, with
pleasure, Juvenal, Terence, Plautus, Seneca the tragedian, and
Greek, Latin, and French authors, ancient and modern.&nbsp; The
writer, behind whom they were ranged, decried the manners of his
age, and exposed the wickedness of hypocrites, who, abusing all
that is sacred in religion, to deceive men, dupe the simple, and
gain an unmerited reputation.&nbsp; Who would believe that a man
was wicked enough to wish to deceive, at the same time, both God
and man?&nbsp; This is what hypocrites do, when under the veil of
divine love, and with an air of humility, more haughty than
vanity itself, they conceal sensual affections, hatred of
brethren, and a licentious life, unknown but to those who
participate in it.&mdash;A woman wishes to hide from her husband
an amorous intrigue; she is at her devotions in the morning, and
in the evening still goes to a lecture, where she knows she shall
see her friend.&nbsp; Often the church itself is the theatre of a
love scene&mdash;the preacher, a fine young man, whose manners
are more fascinating than his discourse.&nbsp; Frequently some
broad-shouldered fellow <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>sets at nought truth, chastity,
continence, the money of husbands, and so forth.&nbsp; Affairs of
business are conducted on the same principle, as those of
love.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who would believe that this devout man was a
usurer: that he had possession, almost for nothing, of the
meadow, the vineyard, and the house of a peasant!&nbsp; Oh, this
is a holy man! he is full of conscience; every day constantly at
church, his piety is exemplary.&nbsp; Behold the fate of a
hypocrite: this knavery, is it any thing but a dead loss? for of
what service is it to bigots to live in such uneasy constraint,
if that does not procure them pleasure, property, or the
gratification of their vanity?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said a woman, &ldquo;can I be accused of
hypocrisy?&nbsp; My virtue, my science, my writings, do they not
demonstrate the unfeignedness of my devotion?&nbsp; Should I be
spoken of in any other way than as Saint Therese?&nbsp; Have I
not had, in that character, apparitions, visions, a spirit of
prophecy, and a discernment into the heart and
conscience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contemplate, sirs,&rdquo; said the satirist, &ldquo;the
people of the spirit, if such a thing is not <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>above your
comprehension.&nbsp; What is this but to deceive the world by
spiritual artifices?&nbsp; What is this incomprehensible new
grace?&nbsp; What devotee but has possessed it; and what mystick
but has held the same language?&nbsp; Truly, madam, grace is very
much obliged to you, and fanaticism owes you thanks; visionaries
and lunaticks have gained their causes; the ancient heretics and
comforters owe you a statue and a chapel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another woman said, &ldquo;I have not had visions; but I have
experienced realities: I have seen what I thought I saw; and if I
had any devotion it was for my directors.&nbsp; I had one whom I
looked upon as my guardian angel; I had for him an extreme
friendship; I made him presents and he never failed in any thing
towards me; I saw him every day, and should have preferred
deceiving my father rather than him.&nbsp; Was he sick, I
suffered also; and to solace him, sent meats, confections,
fruits, and even money.&nbsp; I was so chagrined at his absence
that I could not bear my own house; I became unquiet, impatient
and melancholy; every thing vexed me.&nbsp; His superiors having
<a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>ordered
his change, I almost expired with grief; I wrote to him by every
mail; if I received not his letters, I felt new sorrow: a
thousand phantoms presented themselves to my imagination.&nbsp; I
fancied him as bestowing his pains upon another object, and
thought that absence and change of residence had altered his
inclination.&nbsp; He returned: what rapture!&nbsp; I ran to his
house, although in dishabille: on the morrow I was at his feet;
each day of the week I go to recount to him my pleasures and
pains.&nbsp; In the mean time an honest man sought me in
marriage; I consulted my director; he charged me to dismiss this
man, who accordingly received his farewell.&nbsp; Another brave
cavalier offered himself and received the same answer.&nbsp;
Behold me now in my thirty-fifth year; my director exhorted me to
consecrate to God my virginity: I retired to a monastery, but he
was not willing that I should take the veil.&nbsp; At length he
died; I wept, I regretted him; I observed a nine days&rsquo;
devotion for his death.&nbsp; When my grief was assuaged, I
reflected upon my age: the time of youth was past; I took the
veil, contracted some amiable <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>acquaintances, founded funeral
obsequies for the repose of my soul, bequeathed my estate to the
convent, and died.&nbsp; This is my history; this is true
devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I,&rdquo; said another menette, &ldquo;had no such
object to fix my imagination; I wore invariably a modest dress,
my veil always drawn over my eyes, and sleeves to my very hands:
I rose early in the morning to go to church, and was constantly
seen at all devotional exercises; for me there was neither
parties, assemblies, nor feasts: I did not attach myself to my
confessor, although often at his grate.&nbsp; In the mean time, I
had some good friends, who went about preaching my virtue far and
wide, and principally to those rich men whom they knew not to be
fond of gallantry, and yet exceedingly fearful of what generally
happens to men of their years after marriage.&nbsp; Your affair
is finished, say they to the marrying men; I have discovered a
girl of superlative virtue, who knows not a single man in the
world, and who is so unsophisticated with respect to love
matters, that she does not even know the name of masculine <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>garments;
always engaged in her domestic duties; without luxury, without
vanity, rich withal, and beloved of her father.&nbsp; &lsquo;This
is a girl that will exactly suit me,&rsquo; said an opulent
citizen with sixty years and the gout; &lsquo;I shall have a
nurse for the remainder of my life; I will make her fine
presents, and after my death she shall have the enjoyment of my
estate.&rsquo;&nbsp; In fine, they consulted me with regard to
this man; I demanded time to determine; something unlucky might
happen to my virtue; I asked light from above; heaven appeared
favourable to this union.&nbsp; See me then espoused; I play the
innocent, the ingenuous: my husband, deceived, felicitates
himself in my simplicity: all this time I secretly received the
attentions of a handsome young man; the more I saw him, the
stronger appeared my conjugal attachment.&nbsp; Behold my
history, and discreet devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw still other menettes of different characters, who
exposed the motives of their hypocrisy, and confessed that they
had no other religion.&nbsp; These are liars, for truly religious
souls shun ostentation: true devotion is so considerate, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>that those
who possess it endeavour to conceal it, to avoid being elevated
in the opinion of the world.&nbsp; Christian humility flies the
eulogies of men: their praise seems a dangerous enemy, which, in
flattering, withdraws the heart from the right way; it refuses
the recompense due to merit, and contents itself with affording
that good example, which the honour of virtue and religion
demand; all which, Jupiter, in a homily to the fanatics, set
forth at large.&nbsp; The following is the decree that was then
read and published before this great audience, in presence of the
demons and the damned.</p>
<h3>DECREE OF LUCIFER.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Lucifer</span>, to the legions of
demons and damned people of hell, unhappiness, despair, eternal
pains.&nbsp; In order to the due execution of justice and
vengeance entrusted to our hands, <i>we will</i>, <i>ordain</i>,
and <i>command</i>, under the severest penalties:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, that our demons be always present at the
tribunals of the world, whether secular or canonical; that they
take care of the account <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>books of merchants; prevent soldiers
from thinking of death; trouble the imagination of fanatics;
inspire mundane sentiments in those who wish to enter holy
orders, benefices, and monasteries; that they be the confidants
of intrigues; that they repeat every day, to wives and daughters,
what a lovely young man has said to them once only: in fine, let
nothing be done in the world; let nothing be transacted in the
shops, bureaus, academies, places of commerce, etc. at which they
shall not be present; and we charge them to render an account to
ourselves once a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Secondly, we ordain them reporters, flatterers,
go-betweens, authors of discord, divisions and lawsuits, under
pain of disobedience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirdly, we order, also, in the matter which concerns
those condemned to hell, that the judgments we have pronounced
against them in their causes be put into immediate execution;
that all those who have been condemned, whether individually or
collectively, return to their cells, resume their irons, and
there remain to all eternity, without hope of solace, or change
in their sufferings.&nbsp; Such is <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>our will, and we make no distinction
in favour of pagan gods and goddesses, whom we regard in the same
light as other subjects of our empire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>When Lucifer had spoken, his visage entirely changed; his eyes
became sparkling like two flambeaus; his nostrils cast out smoke
mixed with fire; his mouth exhaled an infectious odour; his hands
and feet changed to claws; from behind him issued a long tail,
upon the end of which was a great button of iron; his ears were
horns like those of the rhinoceros: he spoke again, and his voice
sounded like the crash of thunder.&nbsp; This is the substance of
what he uttered: &ldquo;Let these places return to their former
state; let darkness pervade the whole region; let the prisons
shut with horrid sound upon all this infernal race; let rage and
despair seize upon the damned; let a violent fire devour them;
let the worm of remorse knaw without consuming, and let the
habitude of torment afford no solace.&nbsp; Go, miserable
wretches! obey! precipitate yourselves into these black retreats!
suffer without expiation! and let my ears be sweetly <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>flattered
by the sound of your cries and chains!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Lucifer had pronounced this terrible sentence my demon
transported me out of the hall, and at the same instant I heard
it and the whole palace sink with a horrid crash.&nbsp; Those
crushed among the ruins uttered the most lamentable cries: I then
perceived an immense volume of smoke; after that I found myself
in the midst of the field which is at the extremity of my garden,
from whence I returned to my house, totally absorbed in the
contemplation of this vision.&mdash;If the things here related
did not actually pass in hell as I have supposed, the probability
is, that the fact does not widely differ from the
representation.&nbsp; The judgments of Lucifer are there promptly
executed, without notice to the culprit: cases are decided
without advocates: no person is absolved, for innocence never
enters places destined to eternal punishment.&nbsp; The fire of
hell exposes their perfidious designs, their passions and crimes;
it reveals all secrets, and sets forth the reasons for which the
guilty have been condemned.&nbsp; The sight of suffering
companions <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>affords no relief; it rather augments their grief;
contrary to which, in the world, egotism and corruption render
them insensible to the sufferings of another.&nbsp; The
<i>reformation</i> made by Lucifer operates invisibly in the
commerce of men; the demons and our passions are the causes of
the disorder and injustice that prevail in society.&nbsp; Oh! if
it was possible for each one really to behold what is here only
imagined, how soon would they abandon their careless manner of
life!&nbsp; But ought we to be more wicked because we have less
fear?&nbsp; Let us think, let us think upon the other world; let
us seriously reflect upon our latter end; if that offers us
happiness and rapture, let us, by perseverance, endeavour to
attain it; but if, on the contrary, we anticipate unhappiness and
anguish, let us spare no pains to escape so direful a doom; let
the aspect of hell contribute to the reformation of our manners,
and be so impressed upon our minds as to be the means of our
salvation from the greatest of all evils.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
